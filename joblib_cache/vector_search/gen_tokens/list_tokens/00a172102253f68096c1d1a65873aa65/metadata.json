It begins,\\n\u201cIf you really want to hear about it, the first thing you\u2019ll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don\u2019t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.\u201d\\nHis constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.\\nVersion 1.1 \u2014 FB2 is made by Sclex from html-source taken from IRC-network Undernet, channel #bookz.\\nJerome David Salinger\\nThe Catcher in the Rye\\nTO\\nMY\\nMOTHER\\n1\\nIf you really want to hear about it, the first thing you\u2019ll probably want to know is where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don\u2019t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They\u2019re quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They\u2019re nice and all\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m not saying that\\xa0\u2014 but they\u2019re also touchy as hell. Besides, I\u2019m not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I\u2019ll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean that\u2019s all I told D.B. about, and he\u2019s my brother and all. He\u2019s in Hollywood. That isn\u2019t too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He\u2019s going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He\u2019s got a lot of dough, now. He didn\u2019t use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was \u201cThe Secret Goldfish.\u201d It was about this little kid that wouldn\u2019t let anybody look at his goldfish because he\u2019d bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he\u2019s out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there\u2019s one thing I hate, it\u2019s the movies. Don\u2019t even mention them to me.\\nWhere I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this school that\u2019s in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You\u2019ve probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse\u2019s picture, it always says: \u201cSince 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men.\u201d Strictly for the birds. They don\u2019t do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn\u2019t know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.\\nAnyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn\u2019t win. I remember around three o\u2019clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn\u2019t see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.\\nThere were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it. I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they\u2019re only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something. Old Selma Thurmer\\xa0\u2014 she was the headmaster\u2019s daughter\\xa0\u2014 showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn\u2019t exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She was a pretty nice girl, though. I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. What I liked about her, she didn\u2019t give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was. She probably knew what a phony slob he was.\\nThe reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I\u2019d just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We\u2019d gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn\u2019t have the meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn\u2019t all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we\u2019d know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way.\\nThe other reason I wasn\u2019t down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn\u2019t see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn\u2019t coming back to Pencey.\\nI forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn\u2019t supposed to come back after Christmas vacation on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself\\xa0\u2014 especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer\\xa0\u2014 but I didn\u2019t do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.\\nAnyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch\u2019s teat, especially on top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The week before that, somebody\u2019d stolen my camel\u2019s-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn\u2019t watching the game too much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I\u2019ve left schools and places I didn\u2019t even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a sad good-by or a bad goodby, but when I leave a place I like to know I\u2019m leaving it. If you don\u2019t, you feel even worse.\\nI was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building. They were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn\u2019t want to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology, Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one\\xa0\u2014 at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer\u2019s house. He didn\u2019t live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.\\nI ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath. I have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I\u2019m quite a heavy smoker, for one thing\\xa0\u2014 that is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year. That\u2019s also how I practically got t.b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff. I\u2019m pretty healthy, though.\\nAnyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204. It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down. I don\u2019t even know what I was running for\\xa0\u2014 I guess I just felt like it. After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing. It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.\\nBoy, I rang that doorbell fast when I got to old Spencer\u2019s house. I was really frozen. My ears were hurting and I could hardly move my fingers at all. \u201cC\u2019mon, c\u2019mon,\u201d I said right out loud, almost, \u201csomebody open the door.\u201d Finally old Mrs. Spencer opened it. They didn\u2019t have a maid or anything, and they always opened the door themselves. They didn\u2019t have too much dough.\\n\u201cHolden!\u201d Mrs. Spencer said. \u201cHow lovely to see you! Come in, dear! Are you frozen to death?\u201d I think she was glad to see me. She liked me. At least, I think she did.\\nBoy, did I get in that house fast. \u201cHow are you, Mrs. Spencer?\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s Mr. Spencer?\u201d\\n\u201cLet me take your coat, dear,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t hear me ask her how Mr. Spencer was. She was sort of deaf.\\nShe hung up my coat in the hall closet, and I sort of brushed my hair back with my hand. I wear a crew cut quite frequently and I never have to comb it much. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Mrs. Spencer?\u201d I said again, only louder, so she\u2019d hear me.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve been just fine, Holden.\u201d She closed the closet door. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d The way she asked me, I knew right away old Spencer\u2019d told her I\u2019d been kicked out.\\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s Mr. Spencer? He over his grippe yet?\u201d\\n\u201cOver it! Holden, he\u2019s behaving like a perfect\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t know what\u2026 He\u2019s in his room, dear. Go right in.\u201d\\n2\\nThey each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old, or even more than that. They got a bang out of things, though\\xa0\u2014 in a half-assed way, of course. I know that sounds mean to say, but I don\u2019t mean it mean. I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still living for. I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to him. That\u2019s awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn\u2019t doing too bad for himself. For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer\u2019d bought off some Indian in Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer\u2019d got a big bang out of buying it. That\u2019s what I mean. You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.\\nHis door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all. I could see where he was sitting. He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket I just told you about. He looked over at me when I knocked. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d he yelled. \u201cCaulfield? Come in, boy.\u201d He was always yelling, outside class. It got on your nerves sometimes.\\nThe minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I\u2019d come. He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops. It was pretty depressing. I\u2019m not too crazy about sick people, anyway. What made it even more depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or something. I don\u2019t much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway. Their bumpy old chests are always showing. And their legs. Old guys\u2019 legs, at beaches and places, always look so white and unhairy. \u201cHello, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cI got your note. Thanks a lot.\u201d He\u2019d written me this note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn\u2019t coming back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do all that. I\u2019d have come over to say good-by anyway.\u201d\\n\u201cHave a seat there, boy,\u201d old Spencer said. He meant the bed.\\nI sat down on it. \u201cHow\u2019s your grippe, sir?\u201d\\n\u201cM\u2019boy, if I felt any better I\u2019d have to send for the doctor,\u201d old Spencer said. That knocked him out. He started chuckling like a madman. Then he finally straightened himself out and said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you down at the game? I thought this was the day of the big game.\u201d\\n\u201cIt is. I was. Only, I just got back from New York with the fencing team,\u201d I said. Boy, his bed was like a rock.\\nHe started getting serious as hell. I knew he would. \u201cSo you\u2019re leaving us, eh?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cYes, sir. I guess I am.\u201d\\nHe started going into this nodding routine. You never saw anybody nod as much in your life as old Spencer did. You never knew if he was nodding a lot because he was thinking and all, or just because he was a nice old guy that didn\u2019t know his ass from his elbow.\\n\u201cWhat did Dr. Thurmer say to you, boy? I understand you had quite a little chat.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, we did. We really did. I was in his office for around two hours, I guess.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat\u2019d he say to you?\u201d\\n\u201cOh\u2026 well, about Life being a game and all. And how you should play it according to the rules. He was pretty nice about it. I mean he didn\u2019t hit the ceiling or anything. He just kept talking about Life being a game and all. You know.\u201d\\n\u201cLife is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, sir. I know it is. I know it.\u201d\\nGame, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then it\u2019s a game, all right\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019ll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren\u2019t any hot-shots, then what\u2019s a game about it? Nothing. No game. \u201cHas Dr. Thurmer written to your parents yet?\u201d old Spencer asked me.\\n\u201cHe said he was going to write them Monday.\u201d\\n\u201cHave you yourself communicated with them?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, sir, I haven\u2019t communicated with them, because I\u2019ll probably see them Wednesday night when I get home.\u201d\\n\u201cAnd how do you think they\u2019ll take the news?\u201d\\n\u201cWell\u2026 they\u2019ll be pretty irritated about it,\u201d I said. \u201cThey really will. This is about the fourth school I\u2019ve gone to.\u201d I shook my head. I shake my head quite a lot. \u201cBoy!\u201d I said. I also say \u201cBoy!\u201d quite a lot. Partly because I have a lousy vocabulary and partly because I act quite young for my age sometimes. I was sixteen then, and I\u2019m seventeen now, and sometimes I act like I\u2019m about thirteen. It\u2019s really ironical, because I\u2019m six foot two and a half and I have gray hair. I really do. The one side of my head\\xa0\u2014 the right side\\xa0\u2014 is full of millions of gray hairs. I\u2019ve had them ever since I was a kid. And yet I still act sometimes like I was only about twelve. Everybody says that, especially my father. It\u2019s partly true, too, but it isn\u2019t all true. People always think something\u2019s all true. I don\u2019t give a damn, except that I get bored sometimes when people tell me to act my age. Sometimes I act a lot older than I am\\xa0\u2014 I really do\\xa0\u2014 but people never notice it. People never notice anything.\\nOld Spencer started nodding again. He also started picking his nose. He made out like he was only pinching it, but he was really getting the old thumb right in there. I guess he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room. I didn\u2019t care, except that it\u2019s pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose.\\nThen he said, \u201cI had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had their little chat with Dr. Thurmer some weeks ago. They\u2019re grand people.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, they are. They\u2019re very nice.\u201d\\nGrand. There\u2019s a word I really hate. It\u2019s a phony. I could puke every time I hear it.\\nThen all of a sudden old Spencer looked like he had something very good, something sharp as a tack, to say to me. He sat up more in his chair and sort of moved around. It was a false alarm, though. All he did was lift the Atlantic Monthly off his lap and try to chuck it on the bed, next to me. He missed. It was only about two inches away, but he missed anyway. I got up and picked it up and put it down on the bed. All of a sudden then, I wanted to get the hell out of the room. I could feel a terrific lecture coming on. I didn\u2019t mind the idea so much, but I didn\u2019t feel like being lectured to and smell Vicks Nose Drops and look at old Spencer in his pajamas and bathrobe all at the same time. I really didn\u2019t.\\nIt started, all right. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, boy?\u201d old Spencer said. He said it pretty tough, too, for him. \u201cHow many subjects did you carry this term?\u201d\\n\u201cFive, sir.\u201d\\n\u201cFive. And how many are you failing in?\u201d\\n\u201cFour.\u201d I moved my ass a little bit on the bed. It was the hardest bed I ever sat on. \u201cI passed English all right,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I had all that Beowulf and Lord Randal My Son stuff when I was at the Whooton School. I mean I didn\u2019t have to do any work in English at all hardly, except write compositions once in a while.\u201d\\nHe wasn\u2019t even listening. He hardly ever listened to you when you said something.\\n\u201cI flunked you in history because you knew absolutely nothing.\u201d\\n\u201cI know that, sir. Boy, I know it. You couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing,\u201d he said over again. That\u2019s something that drives me crazy. When people say something twice that way, after you admit it the first time. Then he said it three times. \u201cBut absolutely nothing. I doubt very much if you opened your textbook even once the whole term. Did you? Tell the truth, boy.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, I sort of glanced through it a couple of times,\u201d I told him. I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. He was mad about history.\\n\u201cYou glanced through it, eh?\u201d he said\\xa0\u2014 very sarcastic. \u201cYour, ah, exam paper is over there on top of my chiffonier. On top of the pile. Bring it here, please.\u201d\\nIt was a very dirty trick, but I went over and brought it over to him\\xa0\u2014 I didn\u2019t have any alternative or anything. Then I sat down on his cement bed again. Boy, you can\u2019t imagine how sorry I was getting that I\u2019d stopped by to say good-by to him.\\nHe started handling my exam paper like it was a turd or something. \u201cWe studied the Egyptians from November 4th to December 2nd,\u201d he said. \u201cYou chose to write about them for the optional essay question. Would you care to hear what you had to say?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, sir, not very much,\u201d I said.\\nHe read it anyway, though. You can\u2019t stop a teacher when they want to do something. They just do it.\\nThe Egyptians were an ancient race of Caucasians residing in one of the northern sections of Africa. The latter as we all know is the largest continent in the Eastern Hemisphere.\\nI had to sit there and listen to that crap. It certainly was a dirty trick.\\nThe Egyptians are extremely interesting to us today for various reasons. Modern science would still like to know what the secret ingredients were that the Egyptians used when they wrapped up dead people so that their faces would not rot for innumerable centuries. This interesting riddle is still quite a challenge to modern science in the twentieth century.\\nHe stopped reading and put my paper down. I was beginning to sort of hate him. \u201cYour essay, shall we say, ends there,\u201d he said in this very sarcastic voice. You wouldn\u2019t think such an old guy would be so sarcastic and all. \u201cHowever, you dropped me a little note, at the bottom of the page,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cI know I did,\u201d I said. I said it very fast because I wanted to stop him before he started reading that out loud. But you couldn\u2019t stop him. He was hot as a firecracker.\\nDEAR Mr. SPENCER [he read out loud]. That is all I know about the Egyptians. I can\u2019t seem to get very interested in them although your lectures are very interesting. It is all right with me if you flunk me though as I am flunking everything else except English anyway.\\nHe put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he\u2019d just beaten hell out of me in ping-pong or something. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve read it out loud to him if he\u2019d written it\\xa0\u2014 I really wouldn\u2019t. In the first place, I\u2019d only written that damn note so that he wouldn\u2019t feel too bad about flunking me.\\n\u201cDo you blame me for flunking you, boy?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cNo, sir! I certainly don\u2019t,\u201d I said. I wished to hell he\u2019d stop calling me \u201cboy\u201d all the time.\\nHe tried chucking my exam paper on the bed when he was through with it. Only, he missed again, naturally. I had to get up again and pick it up and put it on top of the Atlantic Monthly. It\u2019s boring to do that every two minutes.\\n\u201cWhat would you have done in my place?\u201d he said. \u201cTell the truth, boy.\u201d\\nWell, you could see he really felt pretty lousy about flunking me. So I shot the bull for a while. I told him I was a real moron, and all that stuff. I told him how I would\u2019ve done exactly the same thing if I\u2019d been in his place, and how most people didn\u2019t appreciate how tough it is being a teacher. That kind of stuff. The old bull.\\nThe funny thing is, though, I was sort of thinking of something else while I shot the bull. I live in New York, and I was thinking about the lagoon in Central Park, down near Central Park South. I was wondering if it would be frozen over when I got home, and if it was, where did the ducks go. I was wondering where the ducks went when the lagoon got all icy and frozen over. I wondered if some guy came in a truck and took them away to a zoo or something. Or if they just flew away.\\nI\u2019m lucky, though. I mean I could shoot the old bull to old Spencer and think about those ducks at the same time. It\u2019s funny. You don\u2019t have to think too hard when you talk to a teacher. All of a sudden, though, he interrupted me while I was shooting the bull. He was always interrupting you.\\n\u201cHow do you feel about all this, boy? I\u2019d be very interested to know. Very interested.\u201d\\n\u201cYou mean about my flunking out of Pencey and all?\u201d I said. I sort of wished he\u2019d cover up his bumpy chest. It wasn\u2019t such a beautiful view.\\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, I believe you also had some difficulty at the Whooton School and at Elkton Hills.\u201d He didn\u2019t say it just sarcastic, but sort of nasty, too.\\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have too much difficulty at Elkton Hills,\u201d I told him. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly flunk out or anything. I just quit, sort of.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy, may I ask?\u201d\\n\u201cWhy? Oh, well it\u2019s a long story, sir. I mean it\u2019s pretty complicated.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel like going into the whole thing with him. He wouldn\u2019t have understood it anyway. It wasn\u2019t up his alley at all. One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies. That\u2019s all. They were coming in the goddam window. For instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in my life. Ten times worse than old Thurmer. On Sundays, for instance, old Haas went around shaking hands with everybody\u2019s parents when they drove up to school. He\u2019d be charming as hell and all. Except if some boy had little old funny-looking parents. You should\u2019ve seen the way he did with my roommate\u2019s parents. I mean if a boy\u2019s mother was sort of fat or corny-looking or something, and if somebody\u2019s father was one of those guys that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old Hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he\u2019d go talk, for maybe a half an hour, with somebody else\u2019s parents. I can\u2019t stand that stuff. It drives me crazy. It makes me so depressed I go crazy. I hated that goddam Elkton Hills.\\nOld Spencer asked me something then, but I didn\u2019t hear him. I was thinking about old Haas. \u201cWhat, sir?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cDo you have any particular qualms about leaving Pencey?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, I have a few qualms, all right. Sure\u2026 but not too many. Not yet, anyway. I guess it hasn\u2019t really hit me yet. It takes things a while to hit me. All I\u2019m doing right now is thinking about going home Wednesday. I\u2019m a moron.\u201d\\n\u201cDo you feel absolutely no concern for your future, boy?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, I feel some concern for my future, all right. Sure. Sure, I do.\u201d I thought about it for a minute. \u201cBut not too much, I guess. Not too much, I guess.\u201d\\n\u201cYou will,\u201d old Spencer said. \u201cYou will, boy. You will when it\u2019s too late.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t like hearing him say that. It made me sound dead or something. It was very depressing. \u201cI guess I will,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cI\u2019d like to put some sense in that head of yours, boy. I\u2019m trying to help you. I\u2019m trying to help you, if I can.\u201d\\nHe really was, too. You could see that. But it was just that we were too much on opposite sides of the pole, that\u2019s all. \u201cI know you are, sir,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks a lot. No kidding. I appreciate it. I really do.\u201d I got up from the bed then. Boy, I couldn\u2019t\u2019ve sat there another ten minutes to save my life. \u201cThe thing is, though, I have to get going now. I have quite a bit of equipment at the gym I have to get to take home with me. I really do.\u201d He looked up at me and started nodding again, with this very serious look on his face. I felt sorry as hell for him, all of a sudden. But I just couldn\u2019t hang around there any longer, the way we were on opposite sides of the pole, and the way he kept missing the bed whenever he chucked something at it, and his sad old bathrobe with his chest showing, and that grippy smell of Vicks Nose Drops all over the place. \u201cLook, sir. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean it. I\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m just going through a phase right now. Everybody goes through phases and all, don\u2019t they?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, boy. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\\nI hate it when somebody answers that way. \u201cSure. Sure, they do,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean it, sir. Please don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d I sort of put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cOkay?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like a cup of hot chocolate before you go? Mrs. Spencer would be\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI would, I really would, but the thing is, I have to get going. I have to go right to the gym. Thanks, though. Thanks a lot, sir.\u201d\\nThen we shook hands. And all that crap. It made me feel sad as hell, though.\\n\u201cI\u2019ll drop you a line, sir. Take care of your grippe, now.\u201d\\n\u201cGood-by, boy.\u201d\\nAfter I shut the door and started back to the living room, he yelled something at me, but I couldn\u2019t exactly hear him. I\u2019m pretty sure he yelled \u201cGood luck!\u201d at me,\\nI hope to hell not. I\u2019d never yell \u201cGood luck!\u201d at anybody. It sounds terrible, when you think about it.\\n3\\nI\u2019m the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It\u2019s awful. If I\u2019m on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I\u2019m going, I\u2019m liable to say I\u2019m going to the opera. It\u2019s terrible. So when I told old Spencer I had to go to the gym and get my equipment and stuff, that was a sheer lie. I don\u2019t even keep my goddam equipment in the gym.\\nWhere I lived at Pencey, I lived in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing of the new dorms. It was only for juniors and seniors. I was a junior. My roommate was a senior. It was named after this guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey. He made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after he got out of Pencey. What he did, he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece. You should see old Ossenburger. He probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river. Anyway, he gave Pencey a pile of dough, and they named our wing after him. The first football game of the year, he came up to school in this big goddam Cadillac, and we all had to stand up in the grandstand and give him a locomotive\\xa0\u2014 that\u2019s a cheer. Then, the next morning, in chapel, be made a speech that lasted about ten hours. He started off with about fifty corny jokes, just to show us what a regular guy he was. Very big deal. Then he started telling us how he was never ashamed, when he was in some kind of trouble or something, to get right down his knees and pray to God. He told us we should always pray to God\\xa0\u2014 talk to Him and all\\xa0\u2014 wherever we were. He told us we ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he was driving his car. That killed me. I just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the middle of it. He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart. It was a very crude thing to do, in chapel and all, but it was also quite amusing. Old Marsalla. He damn near blew the roof off. Hardly anybody laughed out loud, and old Ossenburger made out like he didn\u2019t even hear it, but old Thurmer, the headmaster, was sitting right next to him on the rostrum and all, and you could tell he heard it. Boy, was he sore. He didn\u2019t say anything then, but the next night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made a speech. He said that the boy that had created the disturbance in chapel wasn\u2019t fit to go to Pencey. We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off another one, right while old Thurmer was making his speech, but be wasn\u2019t in the right mood. Anyway, that\u2019s where I lived at Pencey. Old Ossenburger Memorial Wing, in the new dorms.\\nIt was pretty nice to get back to my room, after I left old Spencer, because everybody was down at the game, and the heat was on in our room, for a change. It felt sort of cosy. I took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar; and then I put on this hat that I\u2019d bought in New York that morning. It was this red hunting hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway, just after I noticed I\u2019d lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back\\xa0\u2014 very corny, I\u2019ll admit, but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way. Then I got this book I was reading and sat down in my chair. There were two chairs in every room. I had one and my roommate, Ward Stradlater, had one. The arms were in sad shape, because everybody was always sitting on them, but they were pretty comfortable chairs.\\nThe book I was reading was this book I took out of the library by mistake. They gave me the wrong book, and I didn\u2019t notice it till I got back to my room. They gave me Out of Africa, by Isak Dinesen. I thought it was going to stink, but it didn\u2019t. It was a very good book. I\u2019m quite illiterate, but I read a lot. My favorite author is my brother D.B., and my next favorite is Ring Lardner. My brother gave me a book by Ring Lardner for my birthday, just before I went to Pencey. It had these very funny, crazy plays in it, and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl that\u2019s always speeding. Only, he\u2019s married, the cop, so be can\u2019t marry her or anything. Then this girl gets killed, because she\u2019s always speeding. That story just about killed me. What I like best is a book that\u2019s at least funny once in a while. I read a lot of classical books, like The Return of the Native and all, and I like them, and I read a lot of war books and mysteries and all, but they don\u2019t knock me out too much. What really knocks me out is a book that, when you\u2019re all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn\u2019t happen much, though. I wouldn\u2019t mind calling this Isak Dinesen up. And Ring Lardner, except that D.B. told me he\u2019s dead. You take that book Of Human Bondage, by Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last summer. It\u2019s a pretty good book and all, but I wouldn\u2019t want to call Somerset Maugham up. I don\u2019t know, He just isn\u2019t the kind of guy I\u2019d want to call up, that\u2019s all. I\u2019d rather call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia Vye.\\nAnyway, I put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book Out of Africa. I\u2019d read it already, but I wanted to read certain parts over again. I\u2019d only read about three pages, though, when I heard somebody coming through the shower curtains. Even without looking up, I knew right away who it was. It was Robert Ackley, this guy that roomed right next to me. There was a shower right between every two rooms in our wing, and about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged in on me. He was probably the only guy in the whole dorm, besides me, that wasn\u2019t down at the game. He hardly ever went anywhere. He was a very peculiar guy. He was a senior, and he\u2019d been at Pencey the whole four years and all, but nobody ever called him anything except \u201cAckley.\u201d Not even Herb Gale, his own roommate, ever called him \u201cBob\u201d or even \u201cAck.\u201d If he ever gets married, his own wife\u2019ll probably call him \u201cAckley.\u201d He was one of these very, very tall, round-shouldered guys\\xa0\u2014 he was about six four\\xa0\u2014 with lousy teeth. The whole time he roomed next to me, I never even once saw him brush his teeth. They always looked mossy and awful, and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something. Besides that, he had a lot of pimples. Not just on his forehead or his chin, like most guys, but all over his whole face. And not only that, he had a terrible personality. He was also sort of a nasty guy. I wasn\u2019t too crazy about him, to tell you the truth.\\nI could feel him standing on the shower ledge, right behind my chair, taking a look to see if Stradlater was around. He hated Stradlater\u2019s guts and he never came in the room if Stradlater was around. He hated everybody\u2019s guts, damn near.\\nHe came down off the shower ledge and came in the room. \u201cHi,\u201d he said. He always said it like he was terrifically bored or terrifically tired. He didn\u2019t want you to think he was visiting you or anything. He wanted you to think he\u2019d come in by mistake, for God\u2019s sake.\\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t look up from my book. With a guy like Ackley, if you looked up from your book you were a goner. You were a goner anyway, but not as quick if you didn\u2019t look up right away.\\nHe started walking around the room, very slow and all, the way he always did, picking up your personal stuff off your desk and chiffonier. He always picked up your personal stuff and looked at it. Boy, could he get on your nerves sometimes. \u201cHow was the fencing?\u201d he said. He just wanted me to quit reading and enjoying myself. He didn\u2019t give a damn about the fencing. \u201cWe win, or what?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cNobody won,\u201d I said. Without looking up, though.\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. He always made you say everything twice.\\n\u201cNobody won,\u201d I said. I sneaked a look to see what he was fiddling around with on my chiffonier. He was looking at this picture of this girl I used to go around with in New York, Sally Hayes. He must\u2019ve picked up that goddam picture and looked at it at least five thousand times since I got it. He always put it back in the wrong place, too, when he was finished. He did it on purpose. You could tell.\\n\u201cNobody won,\u201d he said. \u201cHow come?\u201d\\n\u201cI left the goddam foils and stuff on the subway.\u201d I still didn\u2019t look up at him.\\n\u201cOn the subway, for Chrissake! Ya lost them, ya mean?\u201d\\n\u201cWe got on the wrong subway. I had to keep getting up to look at a goddam map on the wall.\u201d\\nHe came over and stood right in my light. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve read this same sentence about twenty times since you came in.\u201d\\nAnybody else except Ackley would\u2019ve taken the goddam hint. Not him, though. \u201cThink they\u2019ll make ya pay for em?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t give a damn. How \u2019bout sitting down or something, Ackley kid? You\u2019re right in my goddam light.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it when you called him \u201cAckley kid.\u201d He was always telling me I was a goddam kid, because I was sixteen and he was eighteen. It drove him mad when I called him \u201cAckley kid.\u201d\\nHe kept standing there. He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn\u2019t get out of your light when you asked him to. He\u2019d do it, finally, but it took him a lot longer if you asked him to. \u201cWhat the hellya reading?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cGoddam book.\u201d\\nHe shoved my book back with his hand so that he could see the name of it. \u201cAny good?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cThis sentence I\u2019m reading is terrific.\u201d I can be quite sarcastic when I\u2019m in the mood. He didn\u2019t get it, though. He started walking around the room again, picking up all my personal stuff, and Stradlater\u2019s. Finally, I put my book down on the floor. You couldn\u2019t read anything with a guy like Ackley around. It was impossible.\\nI slid way the hell down in my chair and watched old Ackley making himself at home. I was feeling sort of tired from the trip to New York and all, and I started yawning. Then I started horsing around a little bit. Sometimes I horse around quite a lot, just to keep from getting bored. What I did was, I pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around to the front, then pulled it way down over my eyes. That way, I couldn\u2019t see a goddam thing. \u201cI think I\u2019m going blind,\u201d I said in this very hoarse voice. \u201cMother darling, everything\u2019s getting so dark in here.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re nuts. I swear to God,\u201d Ackley said.\\n\u201cMother darling, give me your hand, Why won\u2019t you give me your hand?\u201d\\n\u201cFor Chrissake, grow up.\u201d\\nI started groping around in front of me, like a blind guy, but without getting up or anything. I kept saying, \u201cMother darling, why won\u2019t you give me your hand?\u201d I was only horsing around, naturally. That stuff gives me a bang sometimes. Besides, I know it annoyed hell out of old Ackley. He always brought out the old sadist in me. I was pretty sadistic with him quite often. Finally, I quit, though. I pulled the peak around to the back again, and relaxed.\\n\u201cWho belongs this?\u201d Ackley said. He was holding my roommate\u2019s knee supporter up to show me. That guy Ackley\u2019d pick up anything. He\u2019d even pick up your jock strap or something. I told him it was Stradlater\u2019s. So he chucked it on Stradlater\u2019s bed. He got it off Stradlater\u2019s chiffonier, so he chucked it on the bed.\\nHe came over and sat down on the arm of Stradlater\u2019s chair. He never sat down in a chair. Just always on the arm. \u201cWhere the hellya get that hat?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cNew York.\u201d\\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\\n\u201cA buck.\u201d\\n\u201cYou got robbed.\u201d He started cleaning his goddam fingernails with the end of a match. He was always cleaning his fingernails. It was funny, in a way. His teeth were always mossy-looking, and his ears were always dirty as hell, but he was always cleaning his fingernails. I guess he thought that it made him a very neat guy. He took another look at my hat while he was cleaning them. \u201cUp home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in, for Chrissake,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a deer shooting hat.\u201d\\n\u201cLike hell it is.\u201d I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was taking aim at it. \u201cThis is a people shooting hat,\u201d I said. \u201cI shoot people in this hat.\u201d\\n\u201cYour folks know you got kicked out yet?\u201d\\n\u201cNope.\u201d\\n\u201cWhere the hell\u2019s Stradlater at, anyway?\u201d\\n\u201cDown at the game. He\u2019s got a date.\u201d I yawned. I was yawning all over the place. For one thing, the room was too damn hot. It made you sleepy. At Pencey, you either froze to death or died of the heat.\\n\u201cThe great Stradlater,\u201d Ackley said. \u201cHey. Lend me your scissors a second, willya? Ya got \u2019em handy?\u201d\\n\u201cNo. I packed them already. They\u2019re way in the top of the closet.\u201d\\n\u201cGet \u2019em a second, willya?\u201d Ackley said, \u201cI got this hangnail I want to cut off.\u201d\\nHe didn\u2019t care if you\u2019d packed something or not and had it way in the top of the closet. I got them for him though. I nearly got killed doing it, too. The second I opened the closet door, Stradlater\u2019s tennis racket\\xa0\u2014 in its wooden press and all\\xa0\u2014 fell right on my head. It made a big clunk, and it hurt like hell. It damn near killed old Ackley, though. He started laughing in this very high falsetto voice. He kept laughing the whole time I was taking down my suitcase and getting the scissors out for him. Something like that\\xa0\u2014 a guy getting hit on the head with a rock or something\\xa0\u2014 tickled the pants off Ackley. \u201cYou have a damn good sense of humor, Ackley kid,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou know that?\u201d I handed him the scissors. \u201cLemme be your manager. I\u2019ll get you on the goddam radio.\u201d I sat down in my chair again, and he started cutting his big horny-looking nails. \u201cHow \u2019bout using the table or something?\u201d I said. \u201cCut \u2019em over the table, willya? I don\u2019t feel like walking on your crumby nails in my bare feet tonight.\u201d He kept right on cutting them over the floor, though. What lousy manners. I mean it.\\n\u201cWho\u2019s Stradlater\u2019s date?\u201d he said. He was always keeping tabs on who Stradlater was dating, even though he hated Stradlater\u2019s guts.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d\\n\u201cNo reason. Boy, I can\u2019t stand that sonuvabitch. He\u2019s one sonuvabitch I really can\u2019t stand.\u201d\\n\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about you. He told me he thinks you\u2019re a goddam prince,\u201d I said. I call people a \u201cprince\u201d quite often when I\u2019m horsing around. It keeps me from getting bored or something.\\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this superior attitude all the time,\u201d Ackley said. \u201cI just can\u2019t stand the sonuvabitch. You\u2019d think he\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cDo you mind cutting your nails over the table, hey?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve asked you about fifty\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cHe\u2019s got this goddam superior attitude all the time,\u201d Ackley said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think the sonuvabitch is intelligent. He thinks he is. He thinks he\u2019s about the most\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cAckley! For Chrissake. Willya please cut your crumby nails over the table? I\u2019ve asked you fifty times.\u201d\\nHe started cutting his nails over the table, for a change. The only way he ever did anything was if you yelled at him.\\nI watched him for a while. Then I said, \u201cThe reason you\u2019re sore at Stradlater is because he said that stuff about brushing your teeth once in a while. He didn\u2019t mean to insult you, for cryin\u2019 out loud. He didn\u2019t say it right or anything, but he didn\u2019t mean anything insulting. All he meant was you\u2019d look better and feel better if you sort of brushed your teeth once in a while.\u201d\\n\u201cI brush my teeth. Don\u2019t gimme that.\u201d\\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen you, and you don\u2019t,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t say it nasty, though. I felt sort of sorry for him, in a way. I mean it isn\u2019t too nice, naturally, if somebody tells you you don\u2019t brush your teeth. \u201cStradlater\u2019s all right. He\u2019s not too bad,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him, that\u2019s the trouble.\u201d\\n\u201cI still say he\u2019s a sonuvabitch. He\u2019s a conceited sonuvabitch.\u201d\\n\u201cHe\u2019s conceited, but he\u2019s very generous in some things. He really is,\u201d I said. \u201cLook. Suppose, for instance, Stradlater was wearing a tie or something that you liked. Say he had a tie on that you liked a helluva lot\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m just giving you an example, now. You know what he\u2019d do? He\u2019d probably take it off and give it ta you. He really would. Or\\xa0\u2014 you know what he\u2019d do? He\u2019d leave it on your bed or something. But he\u2019d give you the goddam tie. Most guys would probably just\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cHell,\u201d Ackley said. \u201cIf I had his dough, I would, too.\u201d\\n\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t, Ackley kid. If you had his dough, you\u2019d be one of the biggest\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cStop calling me \u2018Ackley kid,\u2019 God damn it. I\u2019m old enough to be your lousy father.\u201d\\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Boy, he could really be aggravating sometimes. He never missed a chance to let you know you were sixteen and he was eighteen. \u201cIn the first place, I wouldn\u2019t let you in my goddam family,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cWell, just cut out calling me\u2014\u201d\\nAll of a sudden the door opened, and old Stradlater barged in, in a big hurry. He was always in a big hurry. Everything was a very big deal. He came over to me and gave me these two playful as hell slaps on both cheeks\\xa0\u2014 which is something that can be very annoying. \u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou going out anywheres special tonight?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I might. What the hell\u2019s it doing out\\xa0\u2014 snowing?\u201d He had snow all over his coat.\\n\u201cYeah. Listen. If you\u2019re not going out anyplace special, how \u2019bout lending me your hound\u2019s-tooth jacket?\u201d\\n\u201cWho won the game?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the half. We\u2019re leaving,\u201d Stradlater said. \u201cNo kidding, you gonna use your hound\u2019s-tooth tonight or not? I spilled some crap all over my gray flannel.\u201d\\n\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t want you stretching it with your goddam shoulders and all,\u201d I said. We were practically the same height, but he weighed about twice as much as I did. He had these very broad shoulders.\\n\u201cI won\u2019t stretch it.\u201d He went over to the closet in a big hurry. \u201cHow\u2019sa boy, Ackley?\u201d he said to Ackley. He was at least a pretty friendly guy, Stradlater. It was partly a phony kind of friendly, but at least he always said hello to Ackley and all.\\nAckley just sort of grunted when he said \u201cHow\u2019sa boy?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t answer him, but he didn\u2019t have guts enough not to at least grunt. Then he said to me, \u201cI think I\u2019ll get going. See ya later.\u201d\\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room.\\nOld Stradlater started taking off his coat and tie and all. \u201cI think maybe I\u2019ll take a fast shave,\u201d he said. He had a pretty heavy beard. He really did.\\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your date?\u201d I asked him.\\n\u201cShe\u2019s waiting in the Annex.\u201d He went out of the room with his toilet kit and towel under his arm. No shirt on or anything. He always walked around in his bare torso because he thought he had a damn good build. He did, too. I have to admit it.\\n4\\nI didn\u2019t have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because everybody was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off\\xa0\u2014 this nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling \u201cSong of India\u201d while he shaved. He had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always picked out some song that\u2019s hard to whistle even if you\u2019re a good whistler, like \u201cSong of India\u201d or \u201cSlaughter on Tenth Avenue.\u201d He could really mess a song up.\\nYou remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well, so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should\u2019ve seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself. He thought he was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was pretty handsome, too\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019ll admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his picture in your Year Book, they\u2019d right away say, \u201cWho\u2019s this boy?\u201d I mean he was mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were a lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they wouldn\u2019t look handsome if you saw their pictures in the Year Book. They\u2019d look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out. I\u2019ve had that experience frequently.\\nAnyway, I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving, sort of turning the water on and off. I still had my red hunting hat on, with the peak around to the back and all. I really got a bang out of that hat.\\n\u201cHey,\u201d Stradlater said. \u201cWanna do me a big favor?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he\u2019s a real hot-shot, and they\u2019re always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they\u2019re crazy about themself, they think you\u2019re crazy about them, too, and that you\u2019re just dying to do them a favor. It\u2019s sort of funny, in a way.\\n\u201cYou goin\u2019 out tonight?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cI might. I might not. I don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d\\n\u201cI got about a hundred pages to read for history for Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cHow \u2019bout writing a composition for me, for English? I\u2019ll be up the creek if I don\u2019t get the goddam thing in by Monday, the reason I ask. How \u2019bout it?\u201d\\nIt was very ironical. It really was.\\n\u201cI\u2019m the one that\u2019s flunking out of the goddam place, and you\u2019re asking me to write you a goddam composition,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYeah, I know. The thing is, though, I\u2019ll be up the creek if I don\u2019t get it in. Be a buddy. Be a buddyroo. Okay?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t answer him right away. Suspense is good for some bastards like Stradlater.\\n\u201cWhat on?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cAnything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once lived in or something\\xa0\u2014 you know. Just as long as it\u2019s descriptive as hell.\u201d He gave out a big yawn while he said that. Which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass. I mean if somebody yawns right while they\u2019re asking you to do them a goddam favor. \u201cJust don\u2019t do it too good, is all,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks you\u2019re a hot-shot in English, and he knows you\u2019re my roommate. So I mean don\u2019t stick all the commas and stuff in the right place.\u201d\\nThat\u2019s something else that gives me a royal pain. I mean if you\u2019re good at writing compositions and somebody starts talking about commas. Stradlater was always doing that. He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place. He was a little bit like Ackley, that way. I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game. We had a terrific guy on the team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the middle of the floor, without even touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept saying, the whole goddam game, that Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God, how I hate that stuff.\\nI got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while, so I backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance, just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself. I can\u2019t really tap-dance or anything, but it was a stone floor in the can, and it was good for tap-dancing. I started imitating one of those guys in the movies. In one of those musicals. I hate the movies like poison, but I get a bang imitating them. Old Stradlater watched me in the mirror while he was shaving. All I need\u2019s an audience. I\u2019m an exhibitionist. \u201cI\u2019m the goddam Governor\u2019s son,\u201d I said. I was knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the place. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it\u2019s in my goddam blood, tap-dancing.\u201d Old Stradlater laughed. He didn\u2019t have too bad a sense of humor. \u201cIt\u2019s the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies.\u201d I was getting out of breath. I have hardly any wind at all. \u201cThe leading man can\u2019t go on. He\u2019s drunk as a bastard. So who do they get to take his place? Me, that\u2019s who. The little ole goddam Governor\u2019s son.\u201d\\n\u201cWhere\u2019dja get that hat?\u201d Stradlater said. He meant my hunting hat. He\u2019d never seen it before.\\nI was out of breath anyway, so I quit horsing around. I took off my hat and looked at it for about the ninetieth time. \u201cI got it in New York this morning. For a buck. Ya like it?\u201d\\nStradlater nodded. \u201cSharp,\u201d he said. He was only flattering me, though, because right away he said, \u201cListen. Are ya gonna write that composition for me? I have to know.\u201d\\n\u201cIf I get the time, I will. If I don\u2019t, I won\u2019t,\u201d I said. I went over and sat down at the washbowl next to him again. \u201cWho\u2019s your date?\u201d I asked him. \u201cFitzgerald?\u201d\\n\u201cHell, no! I told ya. I\u2019m through with that pig.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah? Give her to me, boy. No kidding. She\u2019s my type.\u201d\\n\u201cTake her\u2026 She\u2019s too old for you.\u201d\\nAll of a sudden\\xa0\u2014 for no good reason, really, except that I was sort of in the mood for horsing around\\xa0\u2014 I felt like jumping off the washbowl and getting old Stradlater in a half nelson. That\u2019s a wrestling hold, in case you don\u2019t know, where you get the other guy around the neck and choke him to death, if you feel like it. So I did it. I landed on him like a goddam panther.\\n\u201cCut it out, Holden, for Chrissake!\u201d Stradlater said. He didn\u2019t feel like horsing around. He was shaving and all. \u201cWuddaya wanna make me do\\xa0\u2014 cut my goddam head off?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t let go, though. I had a pretty good half nelson on him. \u201cLiberate yourself from my viselike grip.\u201d I said.\\n\u201cJe-sus Christ.\u201d He put down his razor, and all of a sudden jerked his arms up and sort of broke my hold on him. He was a very strong guy. I\u2019m a very weak guy. \u201cNow, cut out the crap,\u201d he said. He started shaving himself all over again. He always shaved himself twice, to look gorgeous. With his crumby old razor.\\n\u201cWho is your date if it isn\u2019t Fitzgerald?\u201d I asked him. I sat down on the washbowl next to him again. \u201cThat Phyllis Smith babe?\u201d\\n\u201cNo. It was supposed to be, but the arrangements got all screwed up. I got Bud Thaw\u2019s girl\u2019s roommate now\u2026 Hey. I almost forgot. She knows you.\u201d\\n\u201cWho does?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cMy date.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d I was pretty interested.\\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking\u2026 Uh. Jean Gallagher.\u201d\\nBoy, I nearly dropped dead when he said that.\\n\u201cJane Gallagher,\u201d I said. I even got up from the washbowl when he said that. I damn near dropped dead. \u201cYou\u2019re damn right I know her. She practically lived right next door to me, the summer before last. She had this big damn Doberman pinscher. That\u2019s how I met her. Her dog used to keep coming over in our\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re right in my light, Holden, for Chrissake,\u201d Stradlater said. \u201cYa have to stand right there?\u201d\\nBoy, was I excited, though. I really was.\\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI oughta go down and say hello to her or something. Where is she? In the Annex?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\\n\u201cHow\u2019d she happen to mention me? Does she go to B.M. now? She said she might go there. She said she might go to Shipley, too. I thought she went to Shipley. How\u2019d she happen to mention me?\u201d I was pretty excited. I really was.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, for Chrissake. Lift up, willya? You\u2019re on my towel,\u201d Stradlater said. I was sitting on his stupid towel.\\n\u201cJane Gallagher,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t get over it. \u201cJesus H. Christ.\u201d\\nOld Stradlater was putting Vitalis on his hair. My Vitalis.\\n\u201cShe\u2019s a dancer,\u201d I said. \u201cBallet and all. She used to practice about two hours every day, right in the middle of the hottest weather and all. She was worried that it might make her legs lousy\\xa0\u2014 all thick and all. I used to play checkers with her all the time.\u201d\\n\u201cYou used to play what with her all the time?\u201d\\n\u201cCheckers.\u201d\\n\u201cCheckers, for Chrissake!\u201d\\n\u201cYeah. She wouldn\u2019t move any of her kings. What she\u2019d do, when she\u2019d get a king, she wouldn\u2019t move it. She\u2019d just leave it in the back row. She\u2019d get them all lined up in the back row. Then she\u2019d never use them. She just liked the way they looked when they were all in the back row.\u201d\\nStradlater didn\u2019t say anything. That kind of stuff doesn\u2019t interest most people.\\n\u201cHer mother belonged to the same club we did,\u201d I said. \u201cI used to caddy once in a while, just to make some dough. I caddy\u2019d for her mother a couple of times. She went around in about a hundred and seventy, for nine holes.\u201d\\nStradlater wasn\u2019t hardly listening. He was combing his gorgeous locks.\\n\u201cI oughta go down and at least say hello to her,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cWhy don\u2019tcha?\u201d\\n\u201cI will, in a minute.\u201d\\nHe started parting his hair all over again. It took him about an hour to comb his hair.\\n\u201cHer mother and father were divorced. Her mother was married again to some booze hound,\u201d I said. \u201cSkinny guy with hairy legs. I remember him. He wore shorts all the time. Jane said he was supposed to be a playwright or some goddam thing, but all I ever saw him do was booze all the time and listen to every single goddam mystery program on the radio. And run around the goddam house, naked. With Jane around, and all.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Stradlater said. That really interested him. About the booze hound running around the house naked, with Jane around. Stradlater was a very sexy bastard.\\n\u201cShe had a lousy childhood. I\u2019m not kidding.\u201d\\nThat didn\u2019t interest Stradlater, though. Only very sexy stuff interested him.\\n\u201cJane Gallagher. Jesus\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t get her off my mind. I really couldn\u2019t. \u201cI oughta go down and say hello to her, at least.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy the hell don\u2019tcha, instead of keep saying it?\u201d Stradlater said.\\nI walked over to the window, but you couldn\u2019t see out of it, it was so steamy from all the heat in the can.. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood right now,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t, either. You have to be in the mood for those things. \u201cI thought she went to Shipley. I could\u2019ve sworn she went to Shipley.\u201d I walked around the can for a little while. I didn\u2019t have anything else to do. \u201cDid she enjoy the game?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYeah, I guess so. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\\n\u201cDid she tell you we used to play checkers all the time, or anything?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. For Chrissake, I only just met her,\u201d Stradlater said. He was finished combing his goddam gorgeous hair. He was putting away all his crumby toilet articles.\\n\u201cListen. Give her my regards, willya?\u201d\\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stradlater said, but I knew he probably wouldn\u2019t. You take a guy like Stradlater, they never give your regards to people.\\nHe went back to the room, but I stuck around in the can for a while, thinking about old Jane. Then I went back to the room, too.\\nStradlater was putting on his tie, in front of the mirror, when I got there. He spent around half his goddam life in front of the mirror. I sat down in my chair and sort of watched him for a while.\\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her I got kicked out, willya?\u201d\\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\\nThat was one good thing about Stradlater. You didn\u2019t have to explain every goddam little thing with him, the way you had to do with Ackley. Mostly, I guess, because he wasn\u2019t too interested. That\u2019s really why. Ackley, it was different. Ackley was a very nosy bastard.\\nHe put on my hound\u2019s-tooth jacket.\\n\u201cJesus, now, try not to stretch it all over the place,\u201d I said. I\u2019d only worn it about twice.\\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Where the hell\u2019s my cigarettes?\u201d\\n\u201cOn the desk.\u201d He never knew where he left anything. \u201cUnder your muffler.\u201d He put them in his coat pocket\\xa0\u2014 my coat pocket.\\nI pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden, for a change. I was getting sort of nervous, all of a sudden. I\u2019m quite a nervous guy. \u201cListen, where ya going on your date with her?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYa know yet?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. New York, if we have time. She only signed out for nine-thirty, for Chrissake.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t like the way he said it, so I said, \u201cThe reason she did that, she probably just didn\u2019t know what a handsome, charming bastard you are. If she\u2019d known, she probably would\u2019ve signed out for nine-thirty in the morning.\u201d\\n\u201cGoddam right,\u201d Stradlater said. You couldn\u2019t rile him too easily. He was too conceited. \u201cNo kidding, now. Do that composition for me,\u201d he said. He had his coat on, and he was all ready to go. \u201cDon\u2019t knock yourself out or anything, but just make it descriptive as hell. Okay?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t answer him. I didn\u2019t feel like it. All I said was, \u201cAsk her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row.\u201d\\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stradlater said, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cTake it easy, now.\u201d He banged the hell out of the room.\\nI sat there for about a half hour after he left. I mean I just sat in my chair, not doing anything. I kept thinking about Jane, and about Stradlater having a date with her and all. It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy. I already told you what a sexy bastard Stradlater was.\\nAll of a sudden, Ackley barged back in again, through the damn shower curtains, as usual. For once in my stupid life, I was really glad to see him. He took my mind off the other stuff.\\nHe stuck around till around dinnertime, talking about all the guys at Pencey that he hated their guts, and squeezing this big pimple on his chin. He didn\u2019t even use his handkerchief. I don\u2019t even think the bastard had a handkerchief, if you want to know the truth. I never saw him use one, anyway.\\n5\\nWe always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey. It was supposed to be a big deal, because they gave you steak. I\u2019ll bet a thousand bucks the reason they did that was because a lot of guys\u2019 parents came up to school on Sunday, and old Thurmer probably figured everybody\u2019s mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner last night, and he\u2019d say, \u201cSteak.\u201d What a racket. You should\u2019ve seen the steaks. They were these little hard, dry jobs that you could hardly even cut. You always got these very lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night, and for dessert you got Brown Betty, which nobody ate, except maybe the little kids in the lower school that didn\u2019t know any better\\xa0\u2014 and guys like Ackley that ate everything.\\nIt was nice, though, when we got out of the dining room. There were about three inches of snow on the ground, and it was still coming down like a madman. It looked pretty as hell, and we all started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the place. It was very childish, but everybody was really enjoying themselves.\\nI didn\u2019t have a date or anything, so I and this friend of mine, Mal Brossard, that was on the wrestling team, decided we\u2019d take a bus into Agerstown and have a hamburger and maybe see a lousy movie. Neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night. I asked Mal if he minded if Ackley came along with us. The reason I asked was because Ackley never did anything on Saturday night, except stay in his room and squeeze his pimples or something. Mal said he didn\u2019t mind but that he wasn\u2019t too crazy about the idea. He didn\u2019t like Ackley much. Anyway, we both went to our rooms to get ready and all, and while I was putting on my galoshes and crap, I yelled over and asked old Ackley if he wanted to go to the movies. He could hear me all right through the shower curtains, but he didn\u2019t answer me right away. He was the kind of a guy that hates to answer you right away. Finally he came over, through the goddam curtains, and stood on the shower ledge and asked who was going besides me. He always had to know who was going. I swear, if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere, and you rescued him in a goddam boat, he\u2019d want to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he\u2019d even get in. I told him Mal Brossard was going. He said, \u201cThat bastard\u2026 All right. Wait a second.\u201d You\u2019d think he was doing you a big favor.\\nIt took him about five hours to get ready. While he was doing it, I went over to my window and opened it and packed a snowball with my bare hands. The snow was very good for packing. I didn\u2019t throw it at anything, though. I started to throw it. At a car that was parked across the street. But I changed my mind. The car looked so nice and white. Then I started to throw it at a hydrant, but that looked too nice and white, too. Finally I didn\u2019t throw it at anything. All I did was close the window and walk around the room with the snowball, packing it harder. A little while later, I still had it with me when I and Brossnad and Ackley got on the bus. The bus driver opened the doors and made me throw it out. I told him I wasn\u2019t going to chuck it at anybody, but he wouldn\u2019t believe me. People never believe you.\\nBrossard and Ackley both had seen the picture that was playing, so all we did, we just had a couple of hamburgers and played the pinball machine for a little while, then took the bus back to Pencey. I didn\u2019t care about not seeing the movie, anyway. It was supposed to be a comedy, with Cary Grant in it, and all that crap. Besides, I\u2019d been to the movies with Brossard and Ackley before. They both laughed like hyenas at stuff that wasn\u2019t even funny. I didn\u2019t even enjoy sitting next to them in the movies.\\nIt was only about a quarter to nine when we got back to the dorm. Old Brossard was a bridge fiend, and he started looking around the dorm for a game. Old Ackley parked himself in my room, just for a change. Only, instead of sitting on the arm of Stradlater\u2019s chair, he laid down on my bed, with his face right on my pillow and all. He started talking in this very monotonous voice, and picking at all his pimples. I dropped about a thousand hints, but I couldn\u2019t get rid of him. All he did was keep talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse with the summer before. He\u2019d already told me about it about a hundred times. Every time he told it, it was different. One minute he\u2019d be giving it to her in his cousin\u2019s Buick, the next minute he\u2019d be giving it to her under some boardwalk. It was all a lot of crap, naturally. He was a virgin if ever I saw one. I doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel. Anyway, finally I had to come right out and tell him that I had to write a composition for Stradlater, and that he had to clear the hell out, so I could concentrate. He finally did, but he took his time about it, as usual. After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting hat, and started writing the composition.\\nThe thing was, I couldn\u2019t think of a room or a house or anything to describe the way Stradlater said he had to have. I\u2019m not too crazy about describing rooms and houses anyway. So what I did, I wrote about my brother Allie\u2019s baseball mitt. It was a very descriptive subject. It really was. My brother Allie had this left-handed fielder\u2019s mitt. He was left-handed. The thing that was descriptive about it, though, was that he had poems written all over the fingers and the pocket and everywhere. In green ink. He wrote them on it so that he\u2019d have something to read when he was in the field and nobody was up at bat. He\u2019s dead now. He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18, 1946. You\u2019d have liked him. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their class. And they weren\u2019t just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn\u2019t just that he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody. People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie never did, and he had very red hair. I\u2019ll tell you what kind of red hair he had. I started playing golf when I was only ten years old. I remember once, the summer I was around twelve, teeing off and all, and having a hunch that if I turned around all of a sudden, I\u2019d see Allie. So I did, and sure enough, he was sitting on his bike outside the fence\\xa0\u2014 there was this fence that went all around the course\\xa0\u2014 and he was sitting there, about a hundred and fifty yards behind me, watching me tee off. That\u2019s the kind of red hair he had. God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair. I was only thirteen, and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in the garage. I don\u2019t blame them. I really don\u2019t. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken and everything by that time, and I couldn\u2019t do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I\u2019ll admit, but I hardly didn\u2019t even know I was doing it, and you didn\u2019t know Allie. My hand still hurts me once in a while when it rains and all, and I can\u2019t make a real fist any more\\xa0\u2014 not a tight one, I mean\\xa0\u2014 but outside of that I don\u2019t care much. I mean I\u2019m not going to be a goddam surgeon or a violinist or anything anyway.\\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I wrote Stradlater\u2019s composition about. Old Allie\u2019s baseball mitt. I happened to have it with me, in my suitcase, so I got it out and copied down the poems that were written on it. All I had to do was change Allie\u2019s name so that nobody would know it was my brother and not Stradlater\u2019s. I wasn\u2019t too crazy about doing it, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything else descriptive. Besides, I sort of liked writing about it. It took me about an hour, because I had to use Stradlater\u2019s lousy typewriter, and it kept jamming on me. The reason I didn\u2019t use my own was because I\u2019d lent it to a guy down the hall.\\nIt was around ten-thirty, I guess, when I finished it. I wasn\u2019t tired, though, so I looked out the window for a while. It wasn\u2019t snowing out any more, but every once in a while you could hear a car somewhere not being able to get started. You could also hear old Ackley snoring. Right through the goddam shower curtains you could hear him. He had sinus trouble and he couldn\u2019t breathe too hot when he was asleep. That guy had just about everything. Sinus trouble, pimples, lousy teeth, halitosis, crumby fingernails. You had to feel a little sorry for the crazy sonuvabitch.\\n6\\nSome things are hard to remember. I\u2019m thinking now of when Stradlater got back from his date with Jane. I mean I can\u2019t remember exactly what I was doing when I heard his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor. I probably was still looking out the window, but I swear I can\u2019t remember. I was so damn worried, that\u2019s why. When I really worry about something, I don\u2019t just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something. Only, I don\u2019t go. I\u2019m too worried to go. I don\u2019t want to interrupt my worrying to go. If you knew Stradlater, you\u2019d have been worried, too. I\u2019d double-dated with that bastard a couple of times, and I know what I\u2019m talking about. He was unscrupulous. He really was.\\nAnyway, the corridor was all linoleum and all, and you could hear his goddam footsteps coming right towards the room. I don\u2019t even remember where I was sitting when he came in\\xa0\u2014 at the window, or in my chair or his. I swear I can\u2019t remember.\\nHe came in griping about how cold it was out. Then he said, \u201cWhere the hell is everybody? It\u2019s like a goddam morgue around here.\u201d I didn\u2019t even bother to answer him. If he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was Saturday night and everybody was out or asleep or home for the week end, I wasn\u2019t going to break my neck telling him. He started getting undressed. He didn\u2019t say one goddam word about Jane. Not one. Neither did I. I just watched him. All he did was thank me for letting him wear my hound\u2019s-tooth. He hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet.\\nThen when he was taking off his tie, he asked me if I\u2019d written his goddam composition for him. I told him it was over on his goddam bed. He walked over and read it while he was unbuttoning his shirt. He stood there, reading it, and sort of stroking his bare chest and stomach, with this very stupid expression on his face. He was always stroking his stomach or his chest. He was mad about himself.\\nAll of a sudden, he said, \u201cFor Chrissake, Holden. This is about a goddam baseball glove.\u201d\\n\u201cSo what?\u201d I said. Cold as hell.\\n\u201cWuddaya mean so what? I told ya it had to be about a goddam room or a house or something.\u201d\\n\u201cYou said it had to be descriptive. What the hell\u2019s the difference if it\u2019s about a baseball glove?\u201d\\n\u201cGod damn it.\u201d He was sore as hell. He was really furious. \u201cYou always do everything backasswards.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re flunking the hell out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do one damn thing the way you\u2019re supposed to. I mean it. Not one damn thing.\u201d\\n\u201cAll right, give it back to me, then,\u201d I said. I went over and pulled it right out of his goddam hand. Then I tore it up.\\n\u201cWhat the hellja do that for?\u201d he said.\\nI didn\u2019t even answer him. I just threw the pieces in the wastebasket. Then I lay down on my bed, and we both didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. He got all undressed, down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren\u2019t allowed to smoke in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke. Besides, I did it to annoy Stradlater. It drove him crazy when you broke any rules. He never smoked in the dorm. It was only me.\\nHe still didn\u2019t say one single solitary word about Jane. So finally I said, \u201cYou\u2019re back pretty goddam late if she only signed out for nine-thirty. Did you make her be late signing in?\u201d\\nHe was sitting on the edge of his bed, cutting his goddam toenails, when I asked him that. \u201cCoupla minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cWho the hell signs out for nine-thirty on a Saturday night?\u201d God, how I hated him.\\n\u201cDid you go to New York?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYa crazy? How the hell could we go to New York if she only signed out for nine-thirty?\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s tough.\u201d\\nHe looked up at me. \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cif you\u2019re gonna smoke in the room, how \u2019bout going down to the can and do it? You may be getting the hell out of here, but I have to stick around long enough to graduate.\u201d\\nI ignored him. I really did. I went right on smoking like a madman. All I did was sort of turn over on my side and watched him cut his damn toenails. What a school. You were always watching somebody cut their damn toenails or squeeze their pimples or something.\\n\u201cDid you give her my regards?\u201d I asked him.\\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\\nThe hell he did, the bastard.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d I said. \u201cDid you ask her if she still keeps all her kings in the back row?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t ask her. What the hell ya think we did all night\\xa0\u2014 play checkers, for Chrissake?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t even answer him. God, how I hated him.\\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t go to New York, where\u2019d ya go with her?\u201d I asked him, after a little while. I could hardly keep my voice from shaking all over the place. Boy, was I getting nervous. I just had a feeling something had gone funny.\\nHe was finished cutting his damn toenails. So he got up from the bed, in just his damn shorts and all, and started getting very damn playful. He came over to my bed and started leaning over me and taking these playful as hell socks at my shoulder. \u201cCut it out,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go with her if you didn\u2019t go to New York?\u201d\\n\u201cNowhere. We just sat in the goddam car.\u201d He gave me another one of those playful stupid little socks on the shoulder.\\n\u201cCut it out,\u201d I said. \u201cWhose car?\u201d\\n\u201cEd Banky\u2019s.\u201d\\nEd Banky was the basketball coach at Pencey. Old Stradlater was one of his pets, because he was the center on the team, and Ed Banky always let him borrow his car when he wanted it. It wasn\u2019t allowed for students to borrow faculty guys\u2019 cars, but all the athletic bastards stuck together. In every school I\u2019ve gone to, all the athletic bastards stick together.\\nStradlater kept taking these shadow punches down at my shoulder. He had his toothbrush in his hand, and he put it in his mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d I said. \u201cGive her the time in Ed Banky\u2019s goddam car?\u201d My voice was shaking something awful.\\n\u201cWhat a thing to say. Want me to wash your mouth out with soap?\u201d\\n\u201cDid you?\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s a professional secret, buddy.\u201d\\nThis next part I don\u2019t remember so hot. All I know is I got up from the bed, like I was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all my might, right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open. Only, I missed. I didn\u2019t connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something. It probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. It probably would\u2019ve hurt him a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I can\u2019t make a good fist with that hand. On account of that injury I told you about.\\nAnyway, the next thing I knew, I was on the goddam floor and he was sitting on my chest, with his face all red. That is, he had his goddam knees on my chest, and he weighed about a ton. He had hold of my wrists, too, so I couldn\u2019t take another sock at him. I\u2019d\u2019ve killed him.\\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he kept saying, and his stupid face kept getting redder and redder.\\n\u201cGet your lousy knees off my chest,\u201d I told him. I was almost bawling. I really was. \u201cGo on, get off a me, ya crumby bastard.\u201d\\nHe wouldn\u2019t do it, though. He kept holding onto my wrists and I kept calling him a sonuvabitch and all, for around ten hours. I can hardly even remember what all I said to him. I told him he thought he could give the time to anybody he felt like. I told him he didn\u2019t even care if a girl kept all her kings in the back row or not, and the reason he didn\u2019t care was because he was a goddam stupid moron. He hated it when you called a moron. All morons hate it when you call them a moron.\\n\u201cShut up, now, Holden,\u201d he said with his big stupid red face. \u201cJust shut up, now.\u201d\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know if her first name is Jane or Jean, ya goddam moron!\u201d\\n\u201cNow, shut up, Holden, God damn it\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m warning ya,\u201d he said\\xa0\u2014 I really had him going. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019m gonna slam ya one.\u201d\\n\u201cGet your dirty stinking moron knees off my chest.\u201d\\n\u201cIf I letcha up, will you keep your mouth shut?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t even answer him.\\nHe said it over again. \u201cHolden. If I letcha up, willya keep your mouth shut?\u201d\\n\u201cYes.\u201d\\nHe got up off me, and I got up, too. My chest hurt like hell from his dirty knees. \u201cYou\u2019re a dirty stupid sonuvabitch of a moron,\u201d I told him.\\nThat got him really mad. He shook his big stupid finger in my face. \u201cHolden, God damn it, I\u2019m warning you, now. For the last time. If you don\u2019t keep your yap shut, I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d I said\\xa0\u2014 I was practically yelling. \u201cThat\u2019s just the trouble with all you morons. You never want to discuss anything. That\u2019s the way you can always tell a moron. They never want to discuss anything intellig\u2014\u201d\\nThen he really let one go at me, and the next thing I knew I was on the goddam floor again. I don\u2019t remember if he knocked me out or not, but I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s pretty hard to knock a guy out, except in the goddam movies. But my nose was bleeding all over the place. When I looked up old Stradlater was standing practically right on top of me. He had his goddam toilet kit under his arm. \u201cWhy the hell don\u2019tcha shut up when I tellya to?\u201d he said. He sounded pretty nervous. He probably was scared he\u2019d fractured my skull or something when I hit the floor. It\u2019s too bad I didn\u2019t. \u201cYou asked for it, God damn it,\u201d he said. Boy, did he look worried.\\nI didn\u2019t even bother to get up. I just lay there in the floor for a while, and kept calling him a moron sonuvabitch. I was so mad, I was practically bawling.\\n\u201cListen. Go wash your face,\u201d Stradlater said. \u201cYa hear me?\u201d\\nI told him to go wash his own moron face\\xa0\u2014 which was a pretty childish thing to say, but I was mad as hell. I told him to stop off on the way to the can and give Mrs. Schmidt the time. Mrs. Schmidt was the janitor\u2019s wife. She was around sixty-five.\\nI kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can. Then I got up. I couldn\u2019t find my goddam hunting hat anywhere. Finally I found it. It was under the bed. I put it on, and turned the old peak around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror. You never saw such gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bath robe. It partly scared me and it partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough. I\u2019d only been in about two fights in my life, and I lost both of them. I\u2019m not too tough. I\u2019m a pacifist, if you want to know the truth.\\nI had a feeling old Ackley\u2019d probably heard all the racket and was awake. So I went through the shower curtains into his room, just to see what the hell he was doing. I hardly ever went over to his room. It always had a funny stink in it, because he was so crumby in his personal habits.\\n7\\nA tiny bit of light came through the shower curtains and all from our room, and I could see him lying in bed. I knew damn well he was wide awake. \u201cAckley?\u201d I said. \u201cY\u2019awake?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\\nIt was pretty dark, and I stepped on somebody\u2019s shoe on the floor and damn near fell on my head. Ackley sort of sat up in bed and leaned on his arm. He had a lot of white stuff on his face, for his pimples. He looked sort of spooky in the dark. \u201cWhat the hellya doing, anyway?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cWuddaya mean what the hell am I doing? I was tryna sleep before you guys started making all that noise. What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?\u201d\\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the light?\u201d I couldn\u2019t find the light. I was sliding my hand all over the wall.\\n\u201cWuddaya want the light for? \u2026Right next to your hand.\u201d\\nI finally found the switch and turned it on. Old Ackley put his hand up so the light wouldn\u2019t hurt his eyes.\\n\u201cJesus!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d He meant all the blood and all.\\n\u201cI had a little goddam tiff with Stradlater,\u201d I said. Then I sat down on the floor. They never had any chairs in their room. I don\u2019t know what the hell they did with their chairs. \u201cListen,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you feel like playing a little Canasta?\u201d He was a Canasta fiend.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re still bleeding, for Chrissake. You better put something on it.\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019ll stop. Listen. Ya wanna play a little Canasta or don\u2019tcha?\u201d\\n\u201cCanasta, for Chrissake. Do you know what time it is, by any chance?\u201d\\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t late. It\u2019s only around eleven, eleven-thirty.\u201d\\n\u201cOnly around!\u201d Ackley said. \u201cListen. I gotta get up and go to Mass in the morning, for Chrissake. You guys start hollering and fighting in the middle of the goddam\\xa0\u2014 What the hell was the fight about, anyhow?\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I don\u2019t wanna bore ya, Ackley. I\u2019m thinking of your welfare,\u201d I told him. I never discussed my personal life with him. In the first place, he was even more stupid than Stradlater. Stradlater was a goddam genius next to Ackley. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, \u201cis it okay if I sleep in Ely\u2019s bed tonight? He won\u2019t be back till tomorrow night, will he?\u201d I knew damn well he wouldn\u2019t. Ely went home damn near every week end.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when the hell he\u2019s coming back,\u201d Ackley said.\\nBoy, did that annoy me. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean you don\u2019t know when he\u2019s coming back? He never comes back till Sunday night, does he?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, but for Chrissake, I can\u2019t just tell somebody they can sleep in his goddam bed if they want to.\u201d\\nThat killed me. I reached up from where I was sitting on the floor and patted him on the goddam shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a prince, Ackley kid,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know that?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, I mean it\\xa0\u2014 I can\u2019t just tell somebody they can sleep in\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re a real prince. You\u2019re a gentleman and a scholar, kid,\u201d I said. He really was, too. \u201cDo you happen to have any cigarettes, by any chance?\\xa0\u2014 Say \u2018no\u2019 or I\u2019ll drop dead.\u201d\\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t, as a matter of fact. Listen, what the hell was the fight about?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t answer him. All I did was, I got up and went over and looked out the window. I felt so lonesome, all of a sudden. I almost wished I was dead.\\n\u201cWhat the hell was the fight about, anyhow?\u201d Ackley said, for about the fiftieth time. He certainly was a bore about that.\\n\u201cAbout you,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cAbout me, for Chrissake?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah. I was defending your goddam honor. Stradlater said you had a lousy personality. I couldn\u2019t let him get away with that stuff.\u201d\\nThat got him excited. \u201cHe did? No kidding? He did?\u201d\\nI told him I was only kidding, and then I went over and laid down on Ely\u2019s bed. Boy, did I feel rotten. I felt so damn lonesome.\\n\u201cThis room stinks,\u201d I said. \u201cI can smell your socks from way over here. Don\u2019tcha ever send them to the laundry?\u201d\\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you know what you can do,\u201d Ackley said. What a witty guy. \u201cHow \u2019bout turning off the goddam light?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t turn it off right away, though. I just kept laying there on Ely\u2019s bed, thinking about Jane and all. It just drove me stark staring mad when I thought about her and Stradlater parked somewhere in that fat-assed Ed Banky\u2019s car. Every time I thought about it, I felt like jumping out the window. The thing is, you didn\u2019t know Stradlater. I knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all the time\\xa0\u2014 like Ackley, for instance\\xa0\u2014 but old Stradlater really did it. I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to. That\u2019s the truth.\\n\u201cTell me the story of your fascinating life, Ackley kid,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cHow \u2019bout turning off the goddam light? I gotta get up for Mass in the morning.\u201d\\nI got up and turned it off, if it made him happy. Then I laid down on Ely\u2019s bed again.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019re ya gonna do\\xa0\u2014 sleep in Ely\u2019s bed?\u201d Ackley said. He was the perfect host, boy.\\n\u201cI may. I may not. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it. Only, I\u2019d hate like hell if Ely came in all of a sudden and found some guy\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cRelax. I\u2019m not gonna sleep here. I wouldn\u2019t abuse your goddam hospitality.\u201d\\nA couple of minutes later, he was snoring like mad. I kept laying there in the dark anyway, though, trying not to think about old Jane and Stradlater in that goddam Ed Banky\u2019s car. But it was almost impossible. The trouble was, I knew that guy Stradlater\u2019s technique. That made it even worse. We once double-dated, in Ed Banky\u2019s car, and Stradlater was in the back, with his date, and I was in the front with mine. What a technique that guy had. What he\u2019d do was, he\u2019d start snowing his date in this very quiet, sincere voice\\xa0\u2014 like as if he wasn\u2019t only a very handsome guy but a nice, sincere guy, too. I damn near puked, listening to him. His date kept saying, \u201cNo\\xa0\u2014 please. Please, don\u2019t. Please.\u201d But old Stradlater kept snowing her in this Abraham Lincoln, sincere voice, and finally there\u2019d be this terrific silence in the back of the car. It was really embarrassing. I don\u2019t think he gave that girl the time that night\\xa0\u2014 but damn near. Damn near.\\nWhile I was laying there trying not to think, I heard old Stradlater come back from the can and go in our room. You could hear him putting away his crumby toilet articles and all, and opening the window. He was a fresh-air fiend. Then, a little while later, he turned off the light. He didn\u2019t even look around to see where I was at.\\nIt was even depressing out in the street. You couldn\u2019t even hear any cars any more. I got feeling so lonesome and rotten, I even felt like waking Ackley up.\\n\u201cHey, Ackley,\u201d I said, in sort of a whisper, so Stradlater couldn\u2019t hear me through the shower curtain.\\nAckley didn\u2019t hear me, though.\\n\u201cHey, Ackley!\u201d\\nHe still didn\u2019t hear me. He slept like a rock.\\n\u201cHey, Ackley!\u201d\\nHe heard that, all right.\\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he said. \u201cI was asleep, for Chrissake.\u201d\\n\u201cListen. What\u2019s the routine on joining a monastery?\u201d I asked him. I was sort of toying with the idea of joining one. \u201cDo you have to be a Catholic and all?\u201d\\n\u201cCertainly you have to be a Catholic. You bastard, did you wake me just to ask me a dumb ques\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cAah, go back to sleep. I\u2019m not gonna join one anyway. The kind of luck I have, I\u2019d probably join one with all the wrong kind of monks in it. All stupid bastards. Or just bastards.\u201d\\nWhen I said that, old Ackley sat way the hell up in bed. \u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say about me or anything, but if you start making cracks about my goddam religion, for Chrissake\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cRelax,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody\u2019s making any cracks about your goddam religion.\u201d I got up off Ely\u2019s bed, and started towards the door. I didn\u2019t want to hang around in that stupid atmosphere any more. I stopped on the way, though, and picked up Ackley\u2019s hand, and gave him a big, phony handshake. He pulled it away from me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the idea?\u201d he said.\\n\u201cNo idea. I just want to thank you for being such a goddam prince, that\u2019s all,\u201d I said. I said it in this very sincere voice. \u201cYou\u2019re aces, Ackley kid,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know that?\u201d\\n\u201cWise guy. Someday somebody\u2019s gonna bash your\u2014\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t even bother to listen to him. I shut the damn door and went out in the corridor.\\nEverybody was asleep or out or home for the week end, and it was very, very quiet and depressing in the corridor. There was this empty box of Kolynos toothpaste outside Leahy and Hoffman\u2019s door, and while I walked down towards the stairs, I kept giving it a boot with this sheep-lined slipper I had on. What I thought I\u2019d do, I thought I might go down and see what old Mal Brossard was doing. But all of a sudden, I changed my mind. All of a sudden, I decided what I\u2019d really do, I\u2019d get the hell out of Pencey\\xa0\u2014 right that same night and all. I mean not wait till Wednesday or anything. I just didn\u2019t want to hang around any more. It made me too sad and lonesome. So what I decided to do, I decided I\u2019d take a room in a hotel in New York\\xa0\u2014 some very inexpensive hotel and all\\xa0\u2014 and just take it easy till Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, I\u2019d go home all rested up and feeling swell. I figured my parents probably wouldn\u2019t get old Thurmer\u2019s letter saying I\u2019d been given the ax till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday. I didn\u2019t want to go home or anything till they got it and thoroughly digested it and all. I didn\u2019t want to be around when they first got it. My mother gets very hysterical. She\u2019s not too bad after she gets something thoroughly digested, though. Besides, I sort of needed a little vacation. My nerves were shot. They really were.\\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I decided I\u2019d do. So I went back to the room and turned on the light, to start packing and all. I already had quite a few things packed. Old Stradlater didn\u2019t even wake up. I lit a cigarette and got all dressed and then I packed these two Gladstones I have. It only took me about two minutes. I\u2019m a very rapid packer.\\nOne thing about packing depressed me a little. I had to pack these brand-new ice skates my mother had practically just sent me a couple of days before. That depressed me. I could see my mother going in Spaulding\u2019s and asking the salesman a million dopy questions\\xa0\u2014 and here I was getting the ax again. It made me feel pretty sad. She bought me the wrong kind of skates\\xa0\u2014 I wanted racing skates and she bought hockey\\xa0\u2014 but it made me sad anyway. Almost every time somebody gives me a present, it ends up making me sad.\\nAfter I got all packed, I sort of counted my dough. I don\u2019t remember exactly how much I had, but I was pretty loaded. My grandmother\u2019d just sent me a wad about a week before. I have this grandmother that\u2019s quite lavish with her dough. She doesn\u2019t have all her marbles any more\\xa0\u2014 she\u2019s old as hell\\xa0\u2014 and she keeps sending me money for my birthday about four times a year. Anyway, even though I was pretty loaded, I figured I could always use a few extra bucks. You never know. So what I did was, I went down the hall and woke up Frederick Woodruff, this guy I\u2019d lent my typewriter to. I asked him how much he\u2019d give me for it. He was a pretty wealthy guy. He said he didn\u2019t know. He said he didn\u2019t much want to buy it. Finally he bought it, though. It cost about ninety bucks, and all he bought it for was twenty. He was sore because I\u2019d woke him up.\\nWhen I was all set to go, when I had my bags and all, I stood for a while next to the stairs and took a last look down the goddam corridor. I was sort of crying. I don\u2019t know why. I put my red hunting hat on, and turned the peak around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice, \u201cSleep tight, ya morons!\u201d I\u2019ll bet I woke up every bastard on the whole floor. Then I got the hell out. Some stupid guy had thrown peanut shells all over the stairs, and I damn near broke my crazy neck.\\n8\\nIt was too late to call up for a cab or anything, so I walked the whole way to the station. It wasn\u2019t too far, but it was cold as hell, and the snow made it hard for walking, and my Gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs. I sort of enjoyed the air and all, though. The only trouble was, the cold made my nose hurt, and right under my upper lip, where old Stradlater\u2019d laid one on me. He\u2019d smacked my lip right on my teeth, and it was pretty sore. My ears were nice and warm, though. That hat I bought had earlaps in it, and I put them on\\xa0\u2014 I didn\u2019t give a damn how I looked. Nobody was around anyway. Everybody was in the sack.\\nI was quite lucky when I got to the station, because I only had to wait about ten minutes for a train. While I waited, I got some snow in my hand and washed my face with it. I still had quite a bit of blood on.\\nUsually I like riding on trains, especially at night, with the lights on and the windows so black, and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and sandwiches and magazines. I usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines. If I\u2019m on a train at night, I can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine without puking. You know. One of those stories with a lot of phony, lean-jawed guys named David in it, and a lot of phony girls named Linda or Marcia that are always lighting all the goddam Davids\u2019 pipes for them. I can even read one of those lousy stories on a train at night, usually. But this time, it was different. I just didn\u2019t feel like it. I just sort of sat and not did anything. All I did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket.\\nAll of a sudden, this lady got on at Trenton and sat down next to me. Practically the whole car was empty, because it was pretty late and all, but she sat down next to me, instead of an empty seat, because she had this big bag with her and I was sitting in the front seat. She stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle, where the conductor and everybody could trip over it. She had these orchids on, like she\u2019d just been to a big party or something. She was around forty or forty-five, I guess, but she was very good looking. Women kill me. They really do. I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m oversexed or anything like that\\xa0\u2014 although I am quite sexy. I just like them, I mean. They\u2019re always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle.\\nAnyway, we were sitting there, and all of a sudden she said to me, \u201cExcuse me, but isn\u2019t that a Pencey Prep sticker?\u201d She was looking up at my suitcases, up on the rack.\\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said. She was right. I did have a goddam Pencey sticker on one of my Gladstones. Very corny, I\u2019ll admit.\\n\u201cOh, do you go to Pencey?\u201d she said. She had a nice voice. A nice telephone voice, mostly. She should\u2019ve carried a goddam telephone around with her.\\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cOh, how lovely! Perhaps you know my son, then, Ernest Morrow? He goes to Pencey.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, I do. He\u2019s in my class.\u201d\\nHer son was doubtless the biggest bastard that ever went to Pencey, in the whole crumby history of the school. He was always going down the corridor, after he\u2019d had a shower, snapping his soggy old wet towel at people\u2019s asses. That\u2019s exactly the kind of a guy he was.\\n\u201cOh, how nice!\u201d the lady said. But not corny. She was just nice and all. \u201cI must tell Ernest we met,\u201d she said. \u201cMay I ask your name, dear?\u201d\\n\u201cRudolf Schmidt,\u201d I told her. I didn\u2019t feel like giving her my whole life history. Rudolf Schmidt was the name of the janitor of our dorm.\\n\u201cDo you like Pencey?\u201d she asked me.\\n\u201cPencey? It\u2019s not too bad. It\u2019s not paradise or anything, but it\u2019s as good as most schools. Some of the faculty are pretty conscientious.\u201d\\n\u201cErnest just adores it.\u201d\\n\u201cI know he does,\u201d I said. Then I started shooting the old crap around a little bit. \u201cHe adapts himself very well to things. He really does. I mean he really knows how to adapt himself.\u201d\\n\u201cDo you think so?\u201d she asked me. She sounded interested as hell.\\n\u201cErnest? Sure,\u201d I said. Then I watched her take off her gloves. Boy, was she lousy with rocks.\\n\u201cI just broke a nail, getting out of a cab,\u201d she said. She looked up at me and sort of smiled. She had a terrifically nice smile. She really did. Most people have hardly any smile at all, or a lousy one. \u201cErnest\u2019s father and I sometimes worry about him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe sometimes feel he\u2019s not a terribly good mixer.\u201d\\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d\\n\u201cWell. He\u2019s a very sensitive boy. He\u2019s really never been a terribly good mixer with other boys. Perhaps he takes things a little more seriously than he should at his age.\u201d\\nSensitive. That killed me. That guy Morrow was about as sensitive as a goddam toilet seat.\\nI gave her a good look. She didn\u2019t look like any dope to me. She looked like she might have a pretty damn good idea what a bastard she was the mother of. But you can\u2019t always tell\\xa0\u2014 with somebody\u2019s mother, I mean. Mothers are all slightly insane. The thing is, though, I liked old Morrow\u2019s mother. She was all right. \u201cWould you care for a cigarette?\u201d I asked her.\\nShe looked all around. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is a smoker, Rudolf,\u201d she said. Rudolf. That killed me.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. We can smoke till they start screaming at us,\u201d I said. She took a cigarette off me, and I gave her a light.\\nShe looked nice, smoking. She inhaled and all, but she didn\u2019t wolf the smoke down, the way most women around her age do. She had a lot of charm. She had quite a lot of sex appeal, too, if you really want to know.\\nShe was looking at me sort of funny. \u201cI may be wrong but I believe your nose is bleeding, dear,\u201d she said, all of a sudden.\\nI nodded and took out my handkerchief. \u201cI got hit with a snowball,\u201d I said. \u201cOne of those very icy ones.\u201d I probably would\u2019ve told her what really happened, but it would\u2019ve taken too long. I liked her, though. I was beginning to feel sort of sorry I\u2019d told her my name was Rudolf Schmidt. \u201cOld Ernie,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most popular boys at Pencey. Did you know that?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\\nI nodded. \u201cIt really took everybody quite a long time to get to know him. He\u2019s a funny guy. A strange guy, in lots of ways\\xa0\u2014 know what I mean? Like when I first met him. When I first met him, I thought he was kind of a snobbish person. That\u2019s what I thought. But he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s just got this very original personality that takes you a little while to get to know him.\u201d\\nOld Mrs. Morrow didn\u2019t say anything, but boy, you should\u2019ve seen her. I had her glued to her seat. You take somebody\u2019s mother, all they want to hear about is what a hot-shot their son is.\\nThen I really started chucking the old crap around. \u201cDid he tell you about the elections?\u201d I asked her. \u201cThe class elections?\u201d\\nShe shook her head. I had her in a trance, like. I really did.\\n\u201cWell, a bunch of us wanted old Ernie to be president of the class. I mean he was the unanimous choice. I mean he was the only boy that could really handle the job,\u201d I said\\xa0\u2014 boy, was I chucking it. \u201cBut this other boy\\xa0\u2014 Harry Fencer\\xa0\u2014 was elected. And the reason he was elected, the simple and obvious reason, was because Ernie wouldn\u2019t let us nominate him. Because he\u2019s so darn shy and modest and all. He refused\u2026 Boy, he\u2019s really shy. You oughta make him try to get over that.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t he tell you about it?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d\\nI nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s Ernie. He wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s the one fault with him\\xa0\u2014 he\u2019s too shy and modest. You really oughta get him to try to relax occasionally.\u201d\\nRight that minute, the conductor came around for old Mrs. Morrow\u2019s ticket, and it gave me a chance to quit shooting it. I\u2019m glad I shot it for a while, though. You take a guy like Morrow that\u2019s always snapping their towel at people\u2019s asses\\xa0\u2014 really trying to hurt somebody with it\\xa0\u2014 they don\u2019t just stay a rat while they\u2019re a kid. They stay a rat their whole life. But I\u2019ll bet, after all the crap I shot, Mrs. Morrow\u2019ll keep thinking of him now as this very shy, modest guy that wouldn\u2019t let us nominate him for president. She might. You can\u2019t tell. Mothers aren\u2019t too sharp about that stuff.\\n\u201cWould you care for a cocktail?\u201d I asked her. I was feeling in the mood for one myself. \u201cWe can go in the club car. All right?\u201d\\n\u201cDear, are you allowed to order drinks?\u201d she asked me. Not snotty, though. She was too charming and all to be snotty.\\n\u201cWell, no, not exactly, but I can usually get them on account of my heighth,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I have quite a bit of gray hair.\u201d I turned sideways and showed her my gray hair. It fascinated hell out of her. \u201cC\u2019mon, join me, why don\u2019t you?\u201d I said. I\u2019d\u2019ve enjoyed having her.\\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019d better. Thank you so much, though, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, the club car\u2019s most likely closed. It\u2019s quite late, you know.\u201d She was right. I\u2019d forgotten all about what time it was.\\nThen she looked at me and asked me what I was afraid she was going to ask me. \u201cErnest wrote that he\u2019d be home on Wednesday, that Christmas vacation would start on Wednesday,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t called home suddenly because of illness in the family.\u201d She really looked worried about it. She wasn\u2019t just being nosy, you could tell.\\n\u201cNo, everybody\u2019s fine at home,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I have to have this operation.\u201d\\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. She really was, too. I was right away sorry I\u2019d said it, but it was too late.\\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t very serious. I have this tiny little tumor on the brain.\u201d\\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d She put her hand up to her mouth and all. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be all right and everything! It\u2019s right near the outside. And it\u2019s a very tiny one. They can take it out in about two minutes.\u201d\\nThen I started reading this timetable I had in my pocket. Just to stop lying. Once I get started, I can go on for hours if I feel like it. No kidding. Hours.\\nWe didn\u2019t talk too much after that. She started reading this Vogue she had with her, and I looked out the window for a while. She got off at Newark. She wished me a lot of luck with the operation and all. She kept calling me Rudolf. Then she invited me to visit Ernie during the summer, at Gloucester, Massachusetts. She said their house was right on the beach, and they had a tennis court and all, but I just thanked her and told her I was going to South America with my grandmother. Which was really a hot one, because my grandmother hardly ever even goes out of the house, except maybe to go to a goddam matinee or something. But I wouldn\u2019t visit that sonuvabitch Morrow for all the dough in the world, even if I was desperate.\\n9\\nThe first thing I did when I got off at Penn Station, I went into this phone booth. I felt like giving somebody a buzz. I left my bags right outside the booth so that I could watch them, but as soon as I was inside, I couldn\u2019t think of anybody to call up. My brother D.B. was in Hollywood. My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed around nine o\u2019clock\\xa0\u2014 so I couldn\u2019t call her up. She wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve cared if I\u2019d woke her up, but the trouble was, she wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been the one that answered the phone. My parents would be the ones. So that was out. Then I thought of giving Jane Gallagher\u2019s mother a buzz, and find out when Jane\u2019s vacation started, but I didn\u2019t feel like it. Besides, it was pretty late to call up. Then I thought of calling this girl I used to go around with quite frequently, Sally Hayes, because I knew her Christmas vacation had started already\\xa0\u2014 she\u2019d written me this long, phony letter, inviting me over to help her trim the Christmas tree Christmas Eve and all\\xa0\u2014 but I was afraid her mother\u2019d answer the phone. Her mother knew my mother, and I could picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother I was in New York. Besides, I wasn\u2019t crazy about talking to old Mrs. Hayes on the phone. She once told Sally I was wild. She said I was wild and that I had no direction in life. Then I thought of calling up this guy that went to the Whooton School when I was there, Carl Luce, but I didn\u2019t like him much. So I ended up not calling anybody. I came out of the booth, after about twenty minutes or so, and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the cabs are and got a cab.\\nI\u2019m so damn absent-minded, I gave the driver my regular address, just out of habit and all\\xa0\u2014 I mean I completely forgot I was going to shack up in a hotel for a couple of days and not go home till vacation started. I didn\u2019t think of it till we were halfway through the park. Then I said, \u201cHey, do you mind turning around when you get a chance? I gave you the wrong address. I want to go back downtown.\u201d\\nThe driver was sort of a wise guy. \u201cI can\u2019t turn around here, Mac. This here\u2019s a one-way. I\u2019ll have to go all the way to Ninedieth Street now.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t want to start an argument. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. Then I thought of something, all of a sudden. \u201cHey, listen,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know those ducks in that lagoon right near Central Park South? That little lake? By any chance, do you happen to know where they go, the ducks, when it gets all frozen over? Do you happen to know, by any chance?\u201d I realized it was only one chance in a million.\\nHe turned around and looked at me like I was a madman. \u201cWhat\u2019re ya tryna do, bud?\u201d he said. \u201cKid me?\u201d\\n\u201cNo\\xa0\u2014 I was just interested, that\u2019s all.\u201d\\nHe didn\u2019t say anything more, so I didn\u2019t either. Until we came out of the park at Ninetieth Street. Then he said, \u201cAll right, buddy. Where to?\u201d\\n\u201cWell, the thing is, I don\u2019t want to stay at any hotels on the East Side where I might run into some acquaintances of mine. I\u2019m traveling incognito,\u201d I said. I hate saying corny things like \u201ctraveling incognito.\u201d But when I\u2019m with somebody that\u2019s corny, I always act corny too. \u201cDo you happen to know whose band\u2019s at the Taft or the New Yorker, by any chance?\u201d\\n\u201cNo idear, Mac.\u201d\\n\u201cWell\\xa0\u2014 take me to the Edmont then,\u201d I said. \u201cWould you care to stop on the way and join me for a cocktail? On me. I\u2019m loaded.\u201d\\n\u201cCan\u2019t do it, Mac. Sorry.\u201d He certainly was good company. Terrific personality.\\nWe got to the Edmont Hotel, and I checked in. I\u2019d put on my red hunting cap when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I didn\u2019t want to look like a screwball or something. Which is really ironic. I didn\u2019t know then that the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons. Screwballs all over the place.\\nThey gave me this very crumby room, with nothing to look out of the window at except the other side of the hotel. I didn\u2019t care much. I was too depressed to care whether I had a good view or not. The bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy around sixty-five. He was even more depressing than the room was. He was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness. I\u2019d rather be bald than do that. Anyway, what a gorgeous job for a guy around sixty-five years old. Carrying people\u2019s suitcases and waiting around for a tip. I suppose he wasn\u2019t too intelligent or anything, but it was terrible anyway.\\nAfter he left, I looked out the window for a while, with my coat on and all. I didn\u2019t have anything else to do. You\u2019d be surprised what was going on on the other side of the hotel. They didn\u2019t even bother to pull their shades down. I saw one guy, a gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something you wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you. First he put his suitcase on the bed. Then he took out all these women\u2019s clothes, and put them on. Real women\u2019s clothes\\xa0\u2014 silk stockings, high-heeled shoes, brassiere, and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all. Then he put on this very tight black evening dress. I swear to God. Then he started walking up and down the room, taking these very small steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror. He was all alone, too. Unless somebody was in the bathroom\\xa0\u2014 I couldn\u2019t see that much. Then, in the window almost right over his, I saw a man and a woman squirting water out of their mouths at each other. It probably was highballs, not water, but I couldn\u2019t see what they had in their glasses. Anyway, first he\u2019d take a swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him\\xa0\u2014 they took turns, for God\u2019s sake. You should\u2019ve seen them. They were in hysterics the whole time, like it was the funniest thing that ever happened. I\u2019m not kidding, the hotel was lousy with perverts. I was probably the only normal bastard in the whole place\\xa0\u2014 and that isn\u2019t saying much. I damn near sent a telegram to old Stradlater telling him to take the first train to New York. He\u2019d have been the king of the hotel.\\nThe trouble was, that kind of junk is sort of fascinating to watch, even if you don\u2019t want it to be. For instance, that girl that was getting water squirted all over her face, she was pretty good-looking. I mean that\u2019s my big trouble. In my mind, I\u2019m probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw. Sometimes I can think of very crumby stuff I wouldn\u2019t mind doing if the opportunity came up. I can even see how it might be quite a lot of fun, in a crumby way, and if you were both sort of drunk and all, to get a girl and squirt water or something all over each other\u2019s face. The thing is, though, I don\u2019t like the idea. It stinks, if you analyze it. I think if you don\u2019t really like a girl, you shouldn\u2019t horse around with her at all, and if you do like her, then you\u2019re supposed to like her face, and if you like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it, like squirting water all over it. It\u2019s really too bad that so much crumby stuff is a lot of fun sometimes. Girls aren\u2019t too much help, either, when you start trying not to get too crumby, when you start trying not to spoil anything really good. I knew this one girl, a couple of years ago, that was even crumbier than I was. Boy, was she crumby! We had a lot of fun, though, for a while, in a crumby way. Sex is something I really don\u2019t understand too hot. You never know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away. Last year I made a rule that I was going to quit horsing around with girls that, deep down, gave me a pain in the ass. I broke it, though, the same week I made it\\xa0\u2014 the same night, as a matter of fact. I spent the whole night necking with a terrible phony named Anne Louise Sherman. Sex is something I just don\u2019t understand. I swear to God I don\u2019t.\\nI started toying with the idea, while I kept standing there, of giving old Jane a buzz\\xa0\u2014 I mean calling her long distance at B.M., where she went, instead of calling up her mother to find out when she was coming home. You weren\u2019t supposed to call students up late at night, but I had it all figured out. I was going to tell whoever answered the phone that I was her uncle. I was going to say her aunt had just got killed in a car accident and I had to speak to her immediately. It would\u2019ve worked, too. The only reason I didn\u2019t do it was because I wasn\u2019t in the mood. If you\u2019re not in the mood, you can\u2019t do that stuff right.\\nAfter a while I sat down in a chair and smoked a couple of cigarettes. I was feeling pretty horny. I have to admit it. Then, all of a sudden, I got this idea. I took out my wallet and started looking for this address a guy I met at a party last summer, that went to Princeton, gave me. Finally I found it. It was all a funny color from my wallet, but you could still read it. It was the address of this girl that wasn\u2019t exactly a whore or anything but that didn\u2019t mind doing it once in a while, this Princeton guy told me. He brought her to a dance at Princeton once, and they nearly kicked him out for bringing her. She used to be a burlesque stripper or something. Anyway, I went over to the phone and gave her a buzz. Her name was Faith Cavendish, and she lived at the Stanford Arms Hotel on Sixty-fifth and Broadway. A dump, no doubt.\\nFor a while, I didn\u2019t think she was home or something. Nobody kept answering. Then, finally, somebody picked up the phone.\\n\u201cHello?\u201d I said. I made my voice quite deep so that she wouldn\u2019t suspect my age or anything. I have a pretty deep voice anyway.\\n\u201cHello,\u201d this woman\u2019s voice said. None too friendly, either.\\n\u201cIs this Miss Faith Cavendish?\u201d\\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d she said. \u201cWho\u2019s calling me up at this crazy goddam hour?\u201d\\nThat sort of scared me a little bit. \u201cWell, I know it\u2019s quite late,\u201d I said, in this very mature voice and all. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me, but I was very anxious to get in touch with you.\u201d I said it suave as hell. I really did.\\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t know me, but I\u2019m a friend of Eddie Birdsell\u2019s. He suggested that if I were in town sometime, we ought to get together for a cocktail or two.\u201d\\n\u201cWho? You\u2019re a friend of who?\u201d Boy, she was a real tigress over the phone. She was damn near yelling at me.\\n\u201cEdmund Birdsell. Eddie Birdsell,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t remember if his name was Edmund or Edward. I only met him once, at a goddam stupid party.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody by that name, Jack. And if you think I enjoy bein\u2019 woke up in the middle\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cEddie Birdsell? From Princeton?\u201d I said.\\nYou could tell she was running the name over in her mind and all.\\n\u201cBirdsell, Birdsell\u2026 from Princeton.. . Princeton College?\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYou from Princeton College?\u201d\\n\u201cWell, approximately.\u201d\\n\u201cOh\u2026 How is Eddie?\u201d she said. \u201cThis is certainly a peculiar time to call a person up, though. Jesus Christ.\u201d\\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He asked to be remembered to you.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, thank you. Remember me to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a grand person. What\u2019s he doing now?\u201d She was getting friendly as hell, all of a sudden.\\n\u201cOh, you know. Same old stuff,\u201d I said. How the hell did I know what he was doing? I hardly knew the guy. I didn\u2019t even know if he was still at Princeton. \u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cWould you be interested in meeting me for a cocktail somewhere?\u201d\\n\u201cBy any chance do you have any idea what time it is?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, anyhow, may I ask?\u201d She was getting an English accent, all of a sudden. \u201cYou sound a little on the young side.\u201d\\nI laughed. \u201cThank you for the compliment,\u201d I said\\xa0\u2014 suave as hell. \u201cHolden Caulfield\u2019s my name.\u201d I should\u2019ve given her a phony name, but I didn\u2019t think of it.\\n\u201cWell, look, Mr. Cawffle. I\u2019m not in the habit of making engagements in the middle of the night. I\u2019m a working gal.\u201d\\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Sunday,\u201d I told her.\\n\u201cWell, anyway. I gotta get my beauty sleep. You know how it is.\u201d\\n\u201cI thought we might have just one cocktail together. It isn\u2019t too late.\u201d\\n\u201cWell. You\u2019re very sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere ya callin\u2019 from? Where ya at now, anyways?\u201d\\n\u201cMe? I\u2019m in a phone booth.\u201d\\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. Then there was this very long pause. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like awfully to get together with you sometime, Mr. Cawffle. You sound very attractive. You sound like a very attractive person. But it is late.\u201d\\n\u201cI could come up to your place.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, ordinary, I\u2019d say grand. I mean I\u2019d love to have you drop up for a cocktail, but my roommate happens to be ill. She\u2019s been laying here all night without a wink of sleep. She just this minute closed her eyes and all. I mean.\u201d\\n\u201cOh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d\\n\u201cWhere ya stopping at? Perhaps we could get together for cocktails tomorrow.\u201d\\n\u201cI can\u2019t make it tomorrow,\u201d I said. \u201cTonight\u2019s the only time I can make it.\u201d What a dope I was. I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said that.\\n\u201cOh. Well, I\u2019m awfully sorry.\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019ll say hello to Eddie for you.\u201d\\n\u201cWillya do that? I hope you enjoy your stay in New York. It\u2019s a grand place.\u201d\\n\u201cI know it is. Thanks. Good night,\u201d I said. Then I hung up.\\nBoy, I really fouled that up. I should\u2019ve at least made it for cocktails or something.\\n10\\nIt was still pretty early. I\u2019m not sure what time it was, but it wasn\u2019t too late. The one thing I hate to do is go to bed when I\u2019m not even tired. So I opened my suitcases and took out a clean shirt, and then I went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt. What I thought I\u2019d do, I thought I\u2019d go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in the Lavender Room. They had this night club, the Lavender Room, in the hotel.\\nWhile I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a buzz, though. I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone. Somebody with sense and all. But I couldn\u2019t take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was only a little kid and she wouldn\u2019t have been up, let alone anywhere near the phone. I thought of maybe hanging up if my parents answered, but that wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve worked, either. They\u2019d know it was me. My mother always knows it\u2019s me. She\u2019s psychic. But I certainly wouldn\u2019t have minded shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while.\\nYou should see her. You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life. She\u2019s really smart. I mean she\u2019s had all A\u2019s ever since she started school. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m the only dumb one in the family. My brother D.B.\u2019s a writer and all, and my brother Allie, the one that died, that I told you about, was a wizard. I\u2019m the only really dumb one. But you ought to see old Phoebe. She has this sort of red hair, a little bit like Allie\u2019s was, that\u2019s very short in the summertime. In the summertime, she sticks it behind her ears. She has nice, pretty little ears. In the wintertime, it\u2019s pretty long, though. Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s really nice, though. She\u2019s only ten. She\u2019s quite skinny, like me, but nice skinny. Roller-skate skinny. I watched her once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park, and that\u2019s what she is, roller-skate skinny. You\u2019d like her. I mean if you tell old Phoebe something, she knows exactly what the hell you\u2019re talking about. I mean you can even take her anywhere with you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it\u2019s a lousy movie. If you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it\u2019s a pretty good movie. D.B. and I took her to see this French movie, The Baker\u2019s Wife, with Raimu in it. It killed her. Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole goddam movie by heart, because I\u2019ve taken her to see it about ten times. When old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he\u2019s running away from the cops and all, Phoebe\u2019ll say right out loud in the movie\\xa0\u2014 right when the Scotch guy in the picture says it\\xa0\u2014 \u201cCan you eat the herring?\u201d She knows all the talk by heart. And when this professor in the picture, that\u2019s really a German spy, sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old Phoebe beats him to it\\xa0\u2014 she holds up her little finger at me in the dark, right in front of my face. She\u2019s all right. You\u2019d like her. The only trouble is, she\u2019s a little too affectionate sometimes. She\u2019s very emotional, for a child. She really is. Something else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she doesn\u2019t finish them. They\u2019re all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield\\xa0\u2014 only old Phoebe spells it \u201cHazle.\u201d Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She\u2019s supposed to be an orphan, but her old man keeps showing up. Her old man\u2019s always a \u201ctall attractive gentleman about 20 years of age.\u201d That kills me. Old Phoebe. I swear to God you\u2019d like her. She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid. When she was a very tiny little kid, I and Allie used to take her to the park with us, especially on Sundays. Allie had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays, and we used to take old Phoebe with us. She\u2019d wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a lady and all. And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in general, old Phoebe\u2019d be listening. Sometimes you\u2019d forget she was around, because she was such a little kid, but she\u2019d let you know. She\u2019d interrupt you all the time. She\u2019d give Allie or I a push or something, and say, \u201cWho? Who said that? Bobby or the lady?\u201d And we\u2019d tell her who said it, and she\u2019d say, \u201cOh,\u201d and go right on listening and all. She killed Allie, too. I mean he liked her, too. She\u2019s ten now, and not such a tiny little kid any more, but she still kills everybody\\xa0\u2014 everybody with any sense, anyway.\\nAnyway, she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone. But I was too afraid my parents would answer, and then they\u2019d find out I was in New York and kicked out of Pencey and all. So I just finished putting on my shirt. Then I got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on.\\nExcept for a few pimpy-looking guys, and a few whory-looking blondes, the lobby was pretty empty. But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room, and so I went in there. It wasn\u2019t very crowded, but they gave me a lousy table anyway\\xa0\u2014 way in the back. I should\u2019ve waved a buck under the head-waiter\u2019s nose. In New York, boy, money really talks\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m not kidding.\\nThe band was putrid. Buddy Singer. Very brassy, but not good brassy\\xa0\u2014 corny brassy. Also, there were very few people around my age in the place. In fact, nobody was around my age. They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates. Except at the table right next to me. At the table right next to me, there were these three girls around thirty or so. The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didn\u2019t really live in New York, but one of them, the blonde one, wasn\u2019t too bad. She was sort of cute, the blonde one, and I started giving her the old eye a little bit, but just then the waiter came up for my order. I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it\\xa0\u2014 I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you\u2019re under twenty-one and won\u2019t sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cbut do you have some verification of your age? Your driver\u2019s license, perhaps?\u201d\\nI gave him this very cold stare, like he\u2019d insulted the hell out of me, and asked him, \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m under twenty-one?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but we have our\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I said. I figured the hell with it. \u201cBring me a Coke.\u201d He started to go away, but I called him back. \u201cCan\u2019tcha stick a little rum in it or something?\u201d I asked him. I asked him very nicely and all. \u201cI can\u2019t sit in a corny place like this cold sober. Can\u2019tcha stick a little rum in it or something?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, sir\u2026\u201d he said, and beat it on me. I didn\u2019t hold it against him, though. They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor. I\u2019m a goddam minor.\\nI started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again. That is, the blonde one. The other two were strictly from hunger. I didn\u2019t do it crudely, though. I just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all. What they did, though, the three of them, when I did it, they started giggling like morons. They probably thought I was too young to give anybody the once-over. That annoyed hell out of me\\xa0\u2014 you\u2019d\u2019ve thought I wanted to marry them or something. I should\u2019ve given them the freeze, after they did that, but the trouble was, I really felt like dancing. I\u2019m very fond of dancing, sometimes, and that was one of the times. So all of a sudden, I sort of leaned over and said, \u201cWould any of you girls care to dance?\u201d I didn\u2019t ask them crudely or anything. Very suave, in fact. But God damn it, they thought that was a panic, too. They started giggling some more. I\u2019m not kidding, they were three real morons. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll dance with you one at a time. All right? How \u2019bout it? C\u2019mon!\u201d I really felt like dancing.\\nFinally, the blonde one got up to dance with me, because you could tell I was really talking to her, and we walked out to the dance floor. The other two grools nearly had hysterics when we did. I certainly must\u2019ve been very hard up to even bother with any of them.\\nBut it was worth it. The blonde was some dancer. She was one of the best dancers I ever danced with. I\u2019m not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she\u2019s trying to lead you around the dance floor, or else she\u2019s such a lousy dancer, the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her.\\n\u201cYou really can dance,\u201d I told the blonde one. \u201cYou oughta be a pro. I mean it. I danced with a pro once, and you\u2019re twice as good as she was. Did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t even listening to me. She was looking all around the place.\\n\u201cI said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re dancers, she\u2019s a dancer. She\u2019s not too hot, though. She does everything she\u2019s supposed to, but she\u2019s not so hot anyway. You know when a girl\u2019s really a terrific dancer?\u201d\\n\u201cWudga say?\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t listening to me, even. Her mind was wandering all over the place.\\n\u201cI said do you know when a girl\u2019s really a terrific dancer?\u201d\\n\u201cUh-uh.\u201d\\n\u201cWell\\xa0\u2014 where I have my hand on your back. If I think there isn\u2019t anything underneath my hand\\xa0\u2014 no can, no legs, no feet, no anything\\xa0\u2014 then the girl\u2019s really a terrific dancer.\u201d\\nShe wasn\u2019t listening, though. So I ignored her for a while. We just danced. God, could that dopey girl dance. Buddy Singer and his stinking band was playing \u201cJust One of Those Things\u201d and even they couldn\u2019t ruin it entirely. It\u2019s a swell song. I didn\u2019t try any trick stuff while we danced\\xa0\u2014 I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off tricky stuff on the dance floor\\xa0\u2014 but I was moving her around plenty, and she stayed with me. The funny thing is, I thought she was enjoying it, too, till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark. \u201cI and my girl friends saw Peter Lorre last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThe movie actor. In person. He was buyin\u2019 a newspaper. He\u2019s cute.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019re really lucky. You know that?\u201d She was really a moron. But what a dancer. I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey head\\xa0\u2014 you know\\xa0\u2014 right where the part is, and all. She got sore when I did it.\\n\u201cHey! What\u2019s the idea?\u201d\\n\u201cNothing. No idea. You really can dance,\u201d I said. \u201cI have a kid sister that\u2019s only in the goddam fourth grade. You\u2019re about as good as she is, and she can dance better than anybody living or dead.\u201d\\n\u201cWatch your language, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\\nWhat a lady, boy. A queen, for Chrissake.\\n\u201cWhere you girls from?\u201d I asked her.\\nShe didn\u2019t answer me, though. She was busy looking around for old Peter Lorre to show up, I guess.\\n\u201cWhere you girls from?\u201d I asked her again.\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cWhere you girls from? Don\u2019t answer if you don\u2019t feel like it. I don\u2019t want you to strain yourself.\u201d\\n\u201cSeattle, Washington,\u201d she said. She was doing me a big favor to tell me.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very good conversationalist,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou know that?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\\nI let it drop. It was over her head, anyway. \u201cDo you feel like jitterbugging a little bit, if they play a fast one? Not corny jitterbug, not jump or anything\\xa0\u2014 just nice and easy. Everybody\u2019ll all sit down when they play a fast one, except the old guys and the fat guys, and we\u2019ll have plenty of room. Okay?\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s immaterial to me,\u201d she said. \u201cHey\\xa0\u2014 how old are you, anyhow?\u201d\\nThat annoyed me, for some reason. \u201cOh, Christ. Don\u2019t spoil it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m twelve, for Chrissake. I\u2019m big for my age.\u201d\\n\u201cListen. I toleja about that. I don\u2019t like that type language,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna use that type language, I can go sit down with my girl friends, you know.\u201d\\nI apologized like a madman, because the band was starting a fast one. She started jitterbugging with me\\xa0\u2014 but just very nice and easy, not corny. She was really good. All you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love with her by the time we sat down. That\u2019s the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they\u2019re not much to look at, or even if they\u2019re sort of stupid, you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can.\\nThey didn\u2019t invite me to sit down at their table\\xa0\u2014 mostly because they were too ignorant\\xa0\u2014 but I sat down anyway. The blonde I\u2019d been dancing with\u2019s name was Bernice something\\xa0\u2014 Crabs or Krebs. The two ugly ones\u2019 names were Marty and Laverne. I told them my name was Jim Steele, just for the hell of it. Then I tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You had to twist their arms. You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them. And the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room, like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute. They probably thought movie stars always hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York, instead of the Stork Club or El Morocco and all. Anyway, it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in Seattle. They all worked in the same insurance office. I asked them if they liked it, but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes? I thought the two ugly ones, Marty and Laverne, were sisters, but they got very insulted when I asked them. You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one, and you couldn\u2019t blame them, but it was very amusing anyway.\\nI danced with them all\\xa0\u2014 the whole three of them\\xa0\u2014 one at a time. The one ugly one, Laverne, wasn\u2019t too bad a dancer, but the other one, old Marty, was murder. Old Marty was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor. The only way I could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little. So I told her I just saw Gary Cooper, the movie star, on the other side of the floor.\\n\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked me\\xa0\u2014 excited as hell. \u201cWhere?\u201d\\n\u201cAw, you just missed him. He just went out. Why didn\u2019t you look when I told you?\u201d\\nShe practically stopped dancing, and started looking over everybody\u2019s heads to see if she could see him. \u201cOh, shoot!\u201d she said. I\u2019d just about broken her heart\\xa0\u2014 I really had. I was sorry as hell I\u2019d kidded her. Some people you shouldn\u2019t kid, even if they deserve it.\\nHere\u2019s what was very funny, though. When we got back to the table, old Marty told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out. Boy, old Laverne and Bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that. They got all excited and asked Marty if she\u2019d seen him and all. Old Mart said she\u2019d only caught a glimpse of him. That killed me.\\nThe bar was closing up for the night, so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick before it closed, and I ordered two more Cokes for myself. The goddam table was lousy with glasses. The one ugly one, Laverne, kept kidding me because I was only drinking Cokes. She had a sterling sense of humor. She and old Marty were drinking Tom Collinses\\xa0\u2014 in the middle of December, for God\u2019s sake. They didn\u2019t know any better. The blonde one, old Bernice, was drinking bourbon and water. She was really putting it away, too. The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time. They hardly talked\\xa0\u2014 even to each other. Old Marty talked more than the other two. She kept saying these very corny, boring things, like calling the can the \u201clittle girls\u2019 room,\u201d and she thought Buddy Singer\u2019s poor old beat-up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of ice-cold hot licks. She called his clarinet a \u201clicorice stick.\u201d Was she corny. The other ugly one, Laverne, thought she was a very witty type. She kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight. She kept asking me if my father had a date or not. Four times she asked me that\\xa0\u2014 she was certainly witty. Old Bernice, the blonde one, didn\u2019t say hardly anything at all. Every time I\u2019d ask her something, she said \u201cWhat?\u201d That can get on your nerves after a while.\\nAll of a sudden, when they finished their drink, all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed. They said they were going to get up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall. I tried to get them to stick around for a while, but they wouldn\u2019t. So we said good-by and all. I told them I\u2019d look them up in Seattle sometime, if I ever got there, but I doubt if I ever will. Look them up, I mean.\\nWith cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they should\u2019ve at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them\\xa0\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve let them, naturally, but they should\u2019ve at least offered. I didn\u2019t care much, though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. And that business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to New York\\xa0\u2014 from Seattle, Washington, for God\u2019s sake\\xa0\u2014 and ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall, it makes me so depressed I can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019d\u2019ve bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only they hadn\u2019t told me that.\\nI left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did. They were closing it up anyway, and the band had quit a long time ago. In the first place, it was one of those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with, or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes. There isn\u2019t any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk. Or unless you\u2019re with some girl that really knocks you out.\\n11\\nAll of a sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Jane Gallagher on the brain again. I got her on, and I couldn\u2019t get her off. I sat down in this vomity-looking chair in the lobby and thought about her and Stradlater sitting in that goddam Ed Banky\u2019s car, and though I was pretty damn sure old Stradlater hadn\u2019t given her the time\\xa0\u2014 I know old Jane like a book\\xa0\u2014 I still couldn\u2019t get her off my brain. I knew her like a book. I really did. I mean, besides checkers, she was quite fond of all athletic sports, and after I got to know her, the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon. I really got to know her quite intimately. I don\u2019t mean it was anything physical or anything\\xa0\u2014 it wasn\u2019t\\xa0\u2014 but we saw each other all the time. You don\u2019t always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl.\\nThe way I met her, this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn, and my mother got very irritated about it. She called up Jane\u2019s mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived in the house next to ours, but I\u2019d never conversed with her before or anything. She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her that I didn\u2019t give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Jane and I got to be friends and all. I played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I improved her game immensely, though. I\u2019m a very good golfer. If I told you what I go around in, you probably wouldn\u2019t believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I changed my mind at the last minute. I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as I do, I\u2019d be a phony if I let them stick me in a movie short.\\nShe was a funny girl, old Jane. I wouldn\u2019t exactly describe her as strictly beautiful. She knocked me out, though. She was sort of muckle-mouthed. I mean when she was talking and she got excited about something, her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions, her lips and all. That killed me. And she never really closed it all the way, her mouth. It was always just a little bit open, especially when she got in her golf stance, or when she was reading a book. She was always reading, and she read very good books. She read a lot of poetry and all. She was the only one, outside my family, that I ever showed Allie\u2019s baseball mitt to, with all the poems written on it. She\u2019d never met Allie or anything, because that was her first summer in Maine\\xa0\u2014 before that, she went to Cape Cod\\xa0\u2014 but I told her quite a lot about him. She was interested in that kind of stuff.\\nMy mother didn\u2019t like her too much. I mean my mother always thought Jane and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn\u2019t say hello. My mother saw them in the village a lot, because Jane used to drive to market with her mother in this LaSalle convertible they had. My mother didn\u2019t think Jane was pretty, even. I did, though. I just liked the way she looked, that\u2019s all.\\nI remember this one afternoon. It was the only time old Jane and I ever got close to necking, even. It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out, and I was over at her house, on the porch\\xa0\u2014 they had this big screened-in porch. We were playing checkers. I used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn\u2019t take her kings out of the back row. But I didn\u2019t kid her much, though. You never wanted to kid Jane too much. I think I really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises, but it\u2019s a funny thing. The girls I like best are the ones I never feel much like kidding. Sometimes I think they\u2019d like it if you kidded them\\xa0\u2014 in fact, I know they would\\xa0\u2014 but it\u2019s hard to get started, once you\u2019ve known them a pretty long time and never kidded them. Anyway, I was telling you about that afternoon Jane and I came close to necking. It was raining like hell and we were out on her porch, and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked Jane if there were any cigarettes in the house. I didn\u2019t know him too well or anything, but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn\u2019t talk to you much unless he wanted something off you. He had a lousy personality. Anyway, old Jane wouldn\u2019t answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes. So the guy asked her again, but she still wouldn\u2019t answer him. She didn\u2019t even look up from the game. Finally the guy went inside the house. When he did, I asked Jane what the hell was going on. She wouldn\u2019t even answer me, then. She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all. Then all of a sudden, this tear plopped down on the checkerboard. On one of the red squares\\xa0\u2014 boy, I can still see it. She just rubbed it into the board with her finger. I don\u2019t know why, but it bothered hell out of me. So what I did was, I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to her\\xa0\u2014 I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she really started to cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over\\xa0\u2014 anywhere\\xa0\u2014 her eyes, her nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears\\xa0\u2014 her whole face except her mouth and all. She sort of wouldn\u2019t let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest we ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie. I asked her, on the way, if Mr. Cudahy\\xa0\u2014 that was the booze hound\u2019s name\\xa0\u2014 had ever tried to get wise with her. She was pretty young, but she had this terrific figure, and I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve put it past that Cudahy bastard. She said no, though. I never did find out what the hell was the matter. Some girls you practically never find out what\u2019s the matter.\\nI don\u2019t want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something, just because we never necked or horsed around much. She wasn\u2019t. I held hands with her all the time, for instance. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, I realize, but she was terrific to hold hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam hand dies on you, or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time, as if they were afraid they\u2019d bore you or something. Jane was different. We\u2019d get into a goddam movie or something, and right away we\u2019d start holding hands, and we wouldn\u2019t quit till the movie was over. And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it. You never even worried, with Jane, whether your hand was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you were happy. You really were.\\nOne other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Jane did something that just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a sudden I felt this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Jane\u2019s. It was a funny thing to do. I mean she was quite young and all, and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebody\u2019s neck, they\u2019re around twenty-five or thirty and usually they\u2019re doing it to their husband or their little kid\\xa0\u2014 I do it to my kid sister Phoebe once in a while, for instance. But if a girl\u2019s quite young and all and she does it, it\u2019s so pretty it just about kills you.\\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I was thinking about while I sat in that vomity-looking chair in the lobby. Old Jane. Every time I got to the part about her out with Stradlater in that damn Ed Banky\u2019s car, it almost drove me crazy. I knew she wouldn\u2019t let him get to first base with her, but it drove me crazy anyway. I don\u2019t even like to talk about it, if you want to know the truth.\\nThere was hardly anybody in the lobby any more. Even all the whory-looking blondes weren\u2019t around any more, and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out of the place. It was too depressing. And I wasn\u2019t tired or anything. So I went up to my room and put on my coat. I also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action, but the lights and all were out now. I went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to Ernie\u2019s. Ernie\u2019s is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother D.B. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to Hollywood and prostituted himself. He used to take me with him once in a while. Ernie\u2019s a big fat colored guy that plays the piano. He\u2019s a terrific snob and he won\u2019t hardly even talk to you unless you\u2019re a big shot or a celebrity or something, but he can really play the piano. He\u2019s so good he\u2019s almost corny, in fact. I don\u2019t exactly know what I mean by that, but I mean it. I certainly like to hear him play, but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over. I think it\u2019s because sometimes when he plays, he sounds like the kind of guy that won\u2019t talk to you unless you\u2019re a big shot.\\n12\\nThe cab I had was a real old one that smelled like someone\u2019d just tossed his cookies in it. I always get those vomity kind of cabs if I go anywhere late at night. What made it worse, it was so quiet and lonesome out, even though it was Saturday night. I didn\u2019t see hardly anybody on the street. Now and then you just saw a man and a girl crossing a street, with their arms around each other\u2019s waists and all, or a bunch of hoodlumy-looking guys and their dates, all of them laughing like hyenas at something you could bet wasn\u2019t funny. New York\u2019s terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed. I kept wishing I could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old Phoebe. But finally, after I was riding a while, the cab driver and I sort of struck up a conversation. His name was Horwitz. He was a much better guy than the other driver I\u2019d had. Anyway, I thought maybe he might know about the ducks.\\n\u201cHey, Horwitz,\u201d I said. \u201cYou ever pass by the lagoon in Central Park? Down by Central Park South?\u201d\\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\\n\u201cThe lagoon. That little lake, like, there. Where the ducks are. You know.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah, what about it?\u201d\\n\u201cWell, you know the ducks that swim around in it? In the springtime and all? Do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime, by any chance?\u201d\\n\u201cWhere who goes?\u201d\\n\u201cThe ducks. Do you know, by any chance? I mean does somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away, or do they fly away by themselves\\xa0\u2014 go south or something?\u201d\\nOld Horwitz turned all the way around and looked at me. He was a very impatient-type guy. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy, though. \u201cHow the hell should I know?\u201d he said. \u201cHow the hell should I know a stupid thing like that?\u201d\\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t get sore about it,\u201d I said. He was sore about it or something.\\n\u201cWho\u2019s sore? Nobody\u2019s sore.\u201d\\nI stopped having a conversation with him, if he was going to get so damn touchy about it. But he started it up again himself. He turned all the way around again, and said, \u201cThe fish don\u2019t go no place. They stay right where they are, the fish. Right in the goddam lake.\u201d\\n\u201cThe fish\\xa0\u2014 that\u2019s different. The fish is different. I\u2019m talking about the ducks,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s different about it? Nothin\u2019s different about it,\u201d Horwitz said. Everything he said, he sounded sore about something. \u201cIt\u2019s tougher for the fish, the winter and all, than it is for the ducks, for Chrissake. Use your head, for Chrissake.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t say anything for about a minute. Then I said, \u201cAll right. What do they do, the fish and all, when that whole little lake\u2019s a solid block of ice, people skating on it and all?\u201d\\nOld Horwitz turned around again. \u201cWhat the hellaya mean what do they do?\u201d he yelled at me. \u201cThey stay right where they are, for Chrissake.\u201d\\n\u201cThey can\u2019t just ignore the ice. They can\u2019t just ignore it.\u201d\\n\u201cWho\u2019s ignoring it? Nobody\u2019s ignoring it!\u201d Horwitz said. He got so damn excited and all, I was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something. \u201cThey live right in the goddam ice. It\u2019s their nature, for Chrissake. They get frozen right in one position for the whole winter.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah? What do they eat, then? I mean if they\u2019re frozen solid, they can\u2019t swim around looking for food and all.\u201d\\n\u201cTheir bodies, for Chrissake\\xa0\u2014 what\u2019sa matter with ya? Their bodies take in nutrition and all, right through the goddam seaweed and crap that\u2019s in the ice. They got their pores open the whole time. That\u2019s their nature, for Chrissake. See what I mean?\u201d He turned way the hell around again to look at me.\\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. I let it drop. I was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or something. Besides, he was such a touchy guy, it wasn\u2019t any pleasure discussing anything with him. \u201cWould you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere?\u201d I said.\\nHe didn\u2019t answer me, though. I guess he was still thinking. I asked him again, though. He was a pretty good guy. Quite amusing and all.\\n\u201cI ain\u2019t got no time for no liquor, bud,\u201d he said. \u201cHow the hell old are you, anyways? Why ain\u2019tcha home in bed?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d\\nWhen I got out in front of Ernie\u2019s and paid the fare, old Horwitz brought up the fish again. He certainly had it on his mind. \u201cListen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you was a fish, Mother Nature\u2019d take care of you, wouldn\u2019t she? Right? You don\u2019t think them fish just die when it gets to be winter, do ya?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re goddam right they don\u2019t,\u201d Horwitz said, and drove off like a bat out of hell. He was about the touchiest guy I ever met. Everything you said made him sore.\\nEven though it was so late, old Ernie\u2019s was jampacked. Mostly with prep school jerks and college jerks. Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for Christmas vacation than the schools I go to. You could hardly check your coat, it was so crowded. It was pretty quiet, though, because Ernie was playing the piano. It was supposed to be something holy, for God\u2019s sake, when he sat down at the piano. Nobody\u2019s that good. About three couples, besides me, were waiting for tables, and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Ernie while he played. He had a big damn mirror in front of the piano, with this big spotlight on him, so that everybody could watch his face while he played. You couldn\u2019t see his fingers while he played\\xa0\u2014 just his big old face. Big deal. I\u2019m not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing when I came in, but whatever it was, he was really stinking it up. He was putting all these dumb, show-offy ripples in the high notes, and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives me a pain in the ass. You should\u2019ve heard the crowd, though, when he was finished. You would\u2019ve puked. They went mad. They were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the movies at stuff that isn\u2019t funny. I swear to God, if I were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I\u2019d hate it. I wouldn\u2019t even want them to clap for me. People always clap for the wrong things. If I were a piano player, I\u2019d play it in the goddam closet. Anyway, when he was finished, and everybody was clapping their heads off, old Ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony, humble bow. Like as if he was a helluva humble guy, besides being a terrific piano player. It was very phony\\xa0\u2014 I mean him being such a big snob and all. In a funny way, though, I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished. I don\u2019t even think he knows any more when he\u2019s playing right or not. It isn\u2019t all his fault. I partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads off\\xa0\u2014 they\u2019d foul up anybody, if you gave them a chance. Anyway, it made me feel depressed and lousy again, and I damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel, but it was too early and I didn\u2019t feel much like being all alone.\\nThey finally got me this stinking table, right up against a wall and behind a goddam post, where you couldn\u2019t see anything. It was one of those tiny little tables that if the people at the next table don\u2019t get up to let you by\\xa0\u2014 and they never do, the bastards\\xa0\u2014 you practically have to climb into your chair. I ordered a Scotch and soda, which is my favorite drink, next to frozen Daiquiris. If you were only around six years old, you could get liquor at Ernie\u2019s, the place was so dark and all, and besides, nobody cared how old you were. You could even be a dope fiend and nobody\u2019d care.\\nI was surrounded by jerks. I\u2019m not kidding. At this other tiny table, right to my left, practically on top of me, there was this funny-looking guy and this funny-looking girl. They were around my age, or maybe just a little older. It was funny. You could see they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast. I listened to their conversation for a while, because I didn\u2019t have anything else to do. He was telling her about some pro football game he\u2019d seen that afternoon. He gave her every single goddam play in the whole game\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m not kidding. He was the most boring guy I ever listened to. And you could tell his date wasn\u2019t even interested in the goddam game, but she was even funnier-looking than he was, so I guess she had to listen. Real ugly girls have it tough. I feel so sorry for them sometimes. Sometimes I can\u2019t even look at them, especially if they\u2019re with some dopey guy that\u2019s telling them all about a goddam football game. On my right, the conversation was even worse, though. On my right there was this very Joe Yale-looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests. All those Ivy League bastards look alike. My father wants me to go to Yale, or maybe Princeton, but I swear, I wouldn\u2019t go to one of those Ivy League colleges, if I was dying, for God\u2019s sake. Anyway, this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl with him. Boy, she was good-looking. But you should\u2019ve heard the conversation they were having. In the first place, they were both slightly crocked. What he was doing, he was giving her a feel under the table, and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide. His date kept saying to him, \u201cHow horrible\u2026 Don\u2019t, darling. Please, don\u2019t. Not here.\u201d Imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time! They killed me.\\nI certainly began to feel like a prize horse\u2019s ass, though, sitting there all by myself. There wasn\u2019t anything to do except smoke and drink. What I did do, though, I told the waiter to ask old Ernie if he\u2019d care to join me for a drink. I told him to tell him I was D.B.\u2019s brother. I don\u2019t think he ever even gave him my message, though. Those bastards never give your message to anybody.\\nAll of a sudden, this girl came up to me and said, \u201cHolden Caulfield!\u201d Her name was Lillian Simmons. My brother D.B. used to go around with her for a while. She had very big knockers.\\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said. I tried to get up, naturally, but it was some job getting up, in a place like that. She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass.\\n\u201cHow marvelous to see you!\u201d old Lillian Simmons said. Strictly a phony. \u201cHow\u2019s your big brother?\u201d That\u2019s all she really wanted to know.\\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s in Hollywood.\u201d\\n\u201cIn Hollywood! How marvelous! What\u2019s he doing?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Writing,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t feel like discussing it. You could tell she thought it was a big deal, his being in Hollywood. Almost everybody does. Mostly people who\u2019ve never read any of his stories. It drives me crazy, though.\\n\u201cHow exciting,\u201d old Lillian said. Then she introduced me to the Navy guy. His name was Commander Blop or something. He was one of those guys that think they\u2019re being a pansy if they don\u2019t break around forty of your fingers when they shake hands with you. God, I hate that stuff. \u201cAre you all alone, baby?\u201d old Lillian asked me. She was blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle. You could tell she liked to block up a lot of traffic. This waiter was waiting for her to move out of the way, but she didn\u2019t even notice him. It was funny. You could tell the waiter didn\u2019t like her much, you could tell even the Navy guy didn\u2019t like her much, even though he was dating her. And I didn\u2019t like her much. Nobody did. You had to feel sort of sorry for her, in a way. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a date, baby?\u201d she asked me. I was standing up now, and she didn\u2019t even tell me to sit down. She was the type that keeps you standing up for hours. \u201cIsn\u2019t he handsome?\u201d she said to the Navy guy. \u201cHolden, you\u2019re getting handsomer by the minute.\u201d The Navy guy told her to come on. He told her they were blocking up the whole aisle. \u201cHolden, come join us,\u201d old Lillian said. \u201cBring your drink.\u201d\\n\u201cI was just leaving,\u201d I told her. \u201cI have to meet somebody.\u201d You could tell she was just trying to get in good with me. So that I\u2019d tell old D.B. about it.\\n\u201cWell, you little so-and-so. All right for you. Tell your big brother I hate him, when you see him.\u201d\\nThen she left. The Navy guy and I told each other we were glad to\u2019ve met each other. Which always kills me. I\u2019m always saying \u201cGlad to\u2019ve met you\u201d to somebody I\u2019m not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though.\\nAfter I\u2019d told her I had to meet somebody, I didn\u2019t have any goddam choice except to leave. I couldn\u2019t even stick around to hear old Ernie play something halfway decent. But I certainly wasn\u2019t going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy guy and be bored to death. So I left. It made me mad, though, when I was getting my coat. People are always ruining things for you.\\n13\\nI walked all the way back to the hotel. Forty-one gorgeous blocks. I didn\u2019t do it because I felt like walking or anything. It was more because I didn\u2019t feel like getting in and out of another taxicab. Sometimes you get tired of riding in taxicabs the same way you get tired riding in elevators. All of a sudden, you have to walk, no matter how far or how high up. When I was a kid, I used to walk all the way up to our apartment very frequently. Twelve stories.\\nYou wouldn\u2019t even have known it had snowed at all. There was hardly any snow on the sidewalks. But it was freezing cold, and I took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it on\\xa0\u2014 I didn\u2019t give a damn how I looked. I even put the earlaps down. I wished I knew who\u2019d swiped my gloves at Pencey, because my hands were freezing. Not that I\u2019d have done much about it even if I had known. I\u2019m one of these very yellow guys. I try not to show it, but I am. For instance, if I\u2019d found out at Pencey who\u2019d stolen my gloves, I probably would\u2019ve gone down to the crook\u2019s room and said, \u201cOkay. How \u2019bout handing over those gloves?\u201d Then the crook that had stolen them probably would\u2019ve said, his voice very innocent and all, \u201cWhat gloves?\u201d Then what I probably would\u2019ve done, I\u2019d have gone in his closet and found the gloves somewhere. Hidden in his goddam galoshes or something, for instance. I\u2019d have taken them out and showed them to the guy and said, \u201cI suppose these are your goddam gloves?\u201d Then the crook probably would\u2019ve given me this very phony, innocent look, and said, \u201cI never saw those gloves before in my life. If they\u2019re yours, take \u2019em. I don\u2019t want the goddam things.\u201d Then I probably would\u2019ve just stood there for about five minutes. I\u2019d have the damn gloves right in my hand and all, but I\u2019d feel I ought to sock the guy in the jaw or something\\xa0\u2014 break his goddam jaw. Only, I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to do it. I\u2019d just stand there, trying to look tough. What I might do, I might say something very cutting and snotty, to rile him up\\xa0\u2014 instead of socking him in the jaw. Anyway if I did say something very cutting and snotty, he\u2019d probably get up and come over to me and say, \u201cListen, Caulfield. Are you calling me a crook?\u201d Then, instead of saying, \u201cYou\u2019re goddam right I am, you dirty crooked bastard!\u201d all I probably would\u2019ve said would be, \u201cAll I know is my goddam gloves were in your goddam galoshes.\u201d Right away then, the guy would know for sure that I wasn\u2019t going to take a sock at him, and he probably would\u2019ve said, \u201cListen. Let\u2019s get this straight. Are you calling me a thief?\u201d Then I probably would\u2019ve said, \u201cNobody\u2019s calling anybody a thief. All I know is my gloves were in your goddam galoshes.\u201d It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I\u2019d leave his room without even taking a sock at him. I\u2019d probably go down to the can and sneak a cigarette and watch myself getting tough in the mirror. Anyway, that\u2019s what I thought about the whole way back to the hotel. It\u2019s no fun to be yellow. Maybe I\u2019m not all yellow. I don\u2019t know. I think maybe I\u2019m just partly yellow and partly the type that doesn\u2019t give much of a damn if they lose their gloves. One of my troubles is, I never care too much when I lose something\\xa0\u2014 it used to drive my mother crazy when I was a kid. Some guys spend days looking for something they lost. I never seem to have anything that if I lost it I\u2019d care too much. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m partly yellow. It\u2019s no excuse, though. It really isn\u2019t. What you should be is not yellow at all. If you\u2019re supposed to sock somebody in the jaw, and you sort of feel like doing it, you should do it. I\u2019m just no good at it, though. I\u2019d rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights. I don\u2019t mind getting hit so much\\xa0\u2014 although I\u2019m not crazy about it, naturally\\xa0\u2014 but what scares me most in a fist fight is the guy\u2019s face. I can\u2019t stand looking at the other guy\u2019s face, it\u2019s my trouble. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something. It\u2019s a funny kind of yellowness, when you come to think of it, but it\u2019s yellowness, all right. I\u2019m not kidding myself.\\nThe more I thought about my gloves and my yellowness, the more depressed I got, and I decided, while I was walking and all, to stop off and have a drink somewhere. I\u2019d only had three drinks at Ernie\u2019s, and I didn\u2019t even finish the last one. One thing I have, it\u2019s a terrific capacity. I can drink all night and not even show it, if I\u2019m in the mood. Once, at the Whooton School, this other boy, Raymond Goldfarb, and I bought a pint of Scotch and drank it in the chapel one Saturday night, where nobody\u2019d see us. He got stinking, but I hardly didn\u2019t even show it. I just got very cool and nonchalant. I puked before I went to bed, but I didn\u2019t really have to\\xa0\u2014 I forced myself.\\nAnyway, before I got to the hotel, I started to go in this dumpy-looking bar, but two guys came out, drunk as hell, and wanted to know where the subway was. One of them was this very Cuban-looking guy, and he kept breathing his stinking breath in my face while I gave him directions. I ended up not even going in the damn bar. I just went back to the hotel.\\nThe whole lobby was empty. It smelled like fifty million dead cigars. It really did. I wasn\u2019t sleepy or anything, but I was feeling sort of lousy. Depressed and all. I almost wished I was dead.\\nThen, all of a sudden, I got in this big mess.\\nThe first thing when I got in the elevator, the elevator guy said to me, \u201cInnarested in having a good time, fella? Or is it too late for you?\u201d\\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t know what he was driving at or anything.\\n\u201cInnarested in a little tail t\u2019night?\u201d\\n\u201cMe?\u201d I said. Which was a very dumb answer, but it\u2019s quite embarrassing when somebody comes right up and asks you a question like that.\\n\u201cHow old are you, chief?\u201d the elevator guy said.\\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I said. \u201cTwenty-two.\u201d\\n\u201cUh huh. Well, how \u2019bout it? Y\u2019innarested? Five bucks a throw. Fifteen bucks the whole night.\u201d He looked at his wrist watch. \u201cTill noon. Five bucks a throw, fifteen bucks till noon.\u201d\\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. It was against my principles and all, but I was feeling so depressed I didn\u2019t even think. That\u2019s the whole trouble. When you\u2019re feeling very depressed, you can\u2019t even think.\\n\u201cOkay what? A throw, or till noon? I gotta know.\u201d\\n\u201cJust a throw.\u201d\\n\u201cOkay, what room ya in?\u201d\\nI looked at the red thing with my number on it, on my key. \u201cTwelve twenty-two,\u201d I said. I was already sort of sorry I\u2019d let the thing start rolling, but it was too late now.\\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll send a girl up in about fifteen minutes.\u201d He opened the doors and I got out.\\n\u201cHey, is she good-looking?\u201d I asked him. \u201cI don\u2019t want any old bag.\u201d\\n\u201cNo old bag. Don\u2019t worry about it, chief.\u201d\\n\u201cWho do I pay?\u201d\\n\u201cHer,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, chief.\u201d He shut the doors, practically right in my face.\\nI went to my room and put some water on my hair, but you can\u2019t really comb a crew cut or anything. Then I tested to see if my breath stank from so many cigarettes and the Scotch and sodas I drank at Ernie\u2019s. All you do is hold your hand under your mouth and blow your breath up toward the old nostrils. It didn\u2019t seem to stink much, but I brushed my teeth anyway. Then I put on another clean shirt. I knew I didn\u2019t have to get all dolled up for a prostitute or anything, but it sort of gave me something to do. I was a little nervous. I was starting to feel pretty sexy and all, but I was a little nervous anyway. If you want to know the truth, I\u2019m a virgin. I really am. I\u2019ve had quite a few opportunities to lose my virginity and all, but I\u2019ve never got around to it yet. Something always happens. For instance, if you\u2019re at a girl\u2019s house, her parents always come home at the wrong time\\xa0\u2014 or you\u2019re afraid they will. Or if you\u2019re in the back seat of somebody\u2019s car, there\u2019s always somebody\u2019s date in the front seat\\xa0\u2014 some girl, I mean\\xa0\u2014 that always wants to know what\u2019s going on all over the whole goddam car. I mean some girl in front keeps turning around to see what the hell\u2019s going on. Anyway, something always happens. I came quite close to doing it a couple of times, though. One time in particular, I remember. Something went wrong, though \\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t even remember what any more. The thing is, most of the time when you\u2019re coming pretty close to doing it with a girl\\xa0\u2014 a girl that isn\u2019t a prostitute or anything, I mean\\xa0\u2014 she keeps telling you to stop. The trouble with me is, I stop. Most guys don\u2019t. I can\u2019t help it. You never know whether they really want you to stop, or whether they\u2019re just scared as hell, or whether they\u2019re just telling you to stop so that if you do go through with it, the blame\u2019ll be on you, not them. Anyway, I keep stopping. The trouble is, I get to feeling sorry for them. I mean most girls are so dumb and all. After you neck them for a while, you can really watch them losing their brains. You take a girl when she really gets passionate, she just hasn\u2019t any brains. I don\u2019t know. They tell me to stop, so I stop. I always wish I hadn\u2019t, after I take them home, but I keep doing it anyway.\\nAnyway, while I was putting on another clean shirt, I sort of figured this was my big chance, in a way. I figured if she was a prostitute and all, I could get in some practice on her, in case I ever get married or anything. I worry about that stuff sometimes. I read this book once, at the Whooton School, that had this very sophisticated, suave, sexy guy in it. Monsieur Blanchard was his name, I can still remember. It was a lousy book, but this Blanchard guy was pretty good. He had this big ch\u00e2teau and all on the Riviera, in Europe, and all he did in his spare time was beat women off with a club. He was a real rake and all, but he knocked women out. He said, in this one part, that a woman\u2019s body is like a violin and all, and that it takes a terrific musician to play it right. It was a very corny book\\xa0\u2014 I realize that\\xa0\u2014 but I couldn\u2019t get that violin stuff out of my mind anyway. In a way, that\u2019s why I sort of wanted to get some practice in, in case I ever get married. Caulfield and his Magic Violin, boy. It\u2019s corny, I realize, but it isn\u2019t too corny. I wouldn\u2019t mind being pretty good at that stuff. Half the time, if you really want to know the truth, when I\u2019m horsing around with a girl, I have a helluva lot of trouble just finding what I\u2019m looking for, for God\u2019s sake, if you know what I mean. Take this girl that I just missed having sexual intercourse with, that I told you about. It took me about an hour to just get her goddam brassiere off. By the time I did get it off, she was about ready to spit in my eye.\\nAnyway, I kept walking around the room, waiting for this prostitute to show up. I kept hoping she\u2019d be good-looking. I didn\u2019t care too much, though. I sort of just wanted to get it over with. Finally, somebody knocked on the door, and when I went to open it, I had my suitcase right in the way and I fell over it and damn near broke my knee. I always pick a gorgeous time to fall over a suitcase or something.\\nWhen I opened the door, this prostitute was standing there. She had a polo coat on, and no hat. She was sort of a blonde, but you could tell she dyed her hair. She wasn\u2019t any old bag, though. \u201cHow do you do,\u201d I said. Suave as hell, boy.\\n\u201cYou the guy Maurice said?\u201d she asked me. She didn\u2019t seem too goddam friendly.\\n\u201cIs he the elevator boy?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cYes, I am. Come in, won\u2019t you?\u201d I said. I was getting more and more nonchalant as it went along. I really was.\\nShe came in and took her coat off right away and sort of chucked it on the bed. She had on a green dress underneath. Then she sort of sat down sideways on the chair that went with the desk in the room and started jiggling her foot up and down. She crossed her legs and started jiggling this one foot up and down. She was very nervous, for a prostitute. She really was. I think it was because she was young as hell. She was around my age. I sat down in the big chair, next to her, and offered her a cigarette. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke,\u201d she said. She had a tiny little wheeny-whiny voice. You could hardly hear her. She never said thank you, either, when you offered her something. She just didn\u2019t know any better.\\n\u201cAllow me to introduce myself. My name is Jim Steele,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYa got a watch on ya?\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t care what the hell my name was, naturally. \u201cHey, how old are you, anyways?\u201d\\n\u201cMe? Twenty-two.\u201d\\n\u201cLike fun you are.\u201d\\nIt was a funny thing to say. It sounded like a real kid. You\u2019d think a prostitute and all would say \u201cLike hell you are\u201d or \u201cCut the crap\u201d instead of \u201cLike fun you are.\u201d\\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I asked her.\\n\u201cOld enough to know better,\u201d she said. She was really witty. \u201cYa got a watch on ya?\u201d she asked me again, and then she stood up and pulled her dress over her head.\\nI certainly felt peculiar when she did that. I mean she did it so sudden and all. I know you\u2019re supposed to feel pretty sexy when somebody gets up and pulls their dress over their head, but I didn\u2019t. Sexy was about the last thing I was feeling. I felt much more depressed than sexy.\\n\u201cYa got a watch on ya, hey?\u201d\\n\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t,\u201d I said. Boy, was I feeling peculiar. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked her. All she had on was this pink slip. It was really quite embarrassing. It really was.\\n\u201cSunny,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, hey.\u201d\\n\u201cDon\u2019t you feel like talking for a while?\u201d I asked her. It was a childish thing to say, but I was feeling so damn peculiar. \u201cAre you in a very big hurry?\u201d\\nShe looked at me like I was a madman. \u201cWhat the heck ya wanna talk about?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Nothing special. I just thought perhaps you might care to chat for a while.\u201d\\nShe sat down in the chair next to the desk again. She didn\u2019t like it, though, you could tell. She started jiggling her foot again\\xa0\u2014 boy, she was a nervous girl.\\n\u201cWould you care for a cigarette now?\u201d I said. I forgot she didn\u2019t smoke.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t smoke. Listen, if you\u2019re gonna talk, do it. I got things to do.\u201d\\nI couldn\u2019t think of anything to talk about, though. I thought of asking her how she got to be a prostitute and all, but I was scared to ask her. She probably wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve told me anyway.\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t come from New York, do you?\u201d I said finally. That\u2019s all I could think of.\\n\u201cHollywood,\u201d she said. Then she got up and went over to where she\u2019d put her dress down, on the bed. \u201cYa got a hanger? I don\u2019t want to get my dress all wrinkly. It\u2019s brand-clean.\u201d\\n\u201cSure,\u201d I said right away. I was only too glad to get up and do something. I took her dress over to the closet and hung it up for her. It was funny. It made me feel sort of sad when I hung it up. I thought of her going in a store and buying it, and nobody in the store knowing she was a prostitute and all. The salesman probably just thought she was a regular girl when she bought it. It made me feel sad as hell\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t know why exactly.\\nI sat down again and tried to keep the old conversation going. She was a lousy conversationalist. \u201cDo you work every night?\u201d I asked her\\xa0\u2014 it sounded sort of awful, after I\u2019d said it.\\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She was walking all around the room. She picked up the menu off the desk and read it.\\n\u201cWhat do you do during the day?\u201d\\nShe sort of shrugged her shoulders. She was pretty skinny. \u201cSleep. Go to the show.\u201d She put down the menu and looked at me. \u201cLet\u2019s go, hey. I haven\u2019t got all\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very much like myself tonight. I\u2019ve had a rough night. Honest to God. I\u2019ll pay you and all, but do you mind very much if we don\u2019t do it? Do you mind very much?\u201d The trouble was, I just didn\u2019t want to do it. I felt more depressed than sexy, if you want to know the truth. She was depressing. Her green dress hanging in the closet and all. And besides, I don\u2019t think I could ever do it with somebody that sits in a stupid movie all day long. I really don\u2019t think I could.\\nShe came over to me, with this funny look on her face, like as if she didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cWhat\u2019sa matter?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cNothing\u2019s the matter.\u201d Boy, was I getting nervous. \u201cThe thing is, I had an operation very recently.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah? Where?\u201d\\n\u201cOn my wuddayacallit\\xa0\u2014 my clavichord.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah? Where the hell\u2019s that?\u201d\\n\u201cThe clavichord?\u201d I said. \u201cWell, actually, it\u2019s in the spinal canal. I mean it\u2019s quite a ways down in the spinal canal.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough.\u201d Then she sat down on my goddam lap. \u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d\\nShe made me so nervous, I just kept on lying my head off. \u201cI\u2019m still recuperating,\u201d I told her.\\n\u201cYou look like a guy in the movies. You know. Whosis. You know who I mean. What the heck\u2019s his name?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. She wouldn\u2019t get off my goddam lap.\\n\u201cSure you know. He was in that pitcher with Mel-vine Douglas? The one that was Mel-vine Douglas\u2019s kid brother? That falls off this boat? You know who I mean.\u201d\\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I go to the movies as seldom as I can.\u201d\\nThen she started getting funny. Crude and all.\\n\u201cDo you mind cutting it out?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood, I just told you. I just had an operation.\u201d\\nShe didn\u2019t get up from my lap or anything, but she gave me this terrifically dirty look. \u201cListen,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sleepin\u2019 when that crazy Maurice woke me up. If you think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI said I\u2019d pay you for coming and all. I really will. I have plenty of dough. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m practically just recovering from a very serious\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cWhat the heck did you tell that crazy Maurice you wanted a girl for, then? If you just had a goddam operation on your goddam wuddayacallit. Huh?\u201d\\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d be feeling a lot better than I do. I was a little premature in my calculations. No kidding. I\u2019m sorry. If you\u2019ll just get up a second, I\u2019ll get my wallet. I mean it.\u201d\\nShe was sore as hell, but she got up off my goddam lap so that I could go over and get my wallet off the chiffonier. I took out a five-dollar bill and handed it to her. \u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I told her. \u201cThanks a million.\u201d\\n\u201cThis is a five. It costs ten.\u201d\\nShe was getting funny, you could tell. I was afraid something like that would happen\\xa0\u2014 I really was.\\n\u201cMaurice said five,\u201d I told her. \u201cHe said fifteen till noon and only five for a throw.\u201d\\n\u201cTen for a throw.\u201d\\n\u201cHe said five. I\u2019m sorry\\xa0\u2014 I really am\\xa0\u2014 but that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna shell out.\u201d\\nShe sort of shrugged her shoulders, the way she did before, and then she said, very cold, \u201cDo you mind getting me my frock? Or would it be too much trouble?\u201d She was a pretty spooky kid. Even with that little bitty voice she had, she could sort of scare you a little bit. If she\u2019d been a big old prostitute, with a lot of makeup on her face and all, she wouldn\u2019t have been half as spooky.\\nI went and got her dress for her. She put it on and all, and then she picked up her polo coat off the bed. \u201cSo long, crumb-bum,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cSo long,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t thank her or anything. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t.\\n14\\nAfter Old Sunny was gone, I sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarettes. It was getting daylight outside. Boy, I felt miserable. I felt so depressed, you can\u2019t imagine. What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed. I keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of Bobby Fallon\u2019s house. Bobby Fallon used to live quite near us in Maine\\xa0\u2014 this is, years ago. Anyway, what happened was, one day Bobby and I were going over to Lake Sedebego on our bikes. We were going to take our lunches and all, and our BB guns\\xa0\u2014 we were kids and all, and we thought we could shoot something with our BB guns. Anyway, Allie heard us talking about it, and he wanted to go, and I wouldn\u2019t let him. I told him he was a child. So once in a while, now, when I get very depressed, I keep saying to him, \u201cOkay. Go home and get your bike and meet me in front of Bobby\u2019s house. Hurry up.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t use to take him with me when I went somewhere. I did. But that one day, I didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t get sore about it\\xa0\u2014 he never got sore about anything\\xa0\u2014 but I keep thinking about it anyway, when I get very depressed.\\nFinally, though, I got undressed and got in bed. I felt like praying or something, when I was in bed, but I couldn\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t always pray when I feel like it. In the first place, I\u2019m sort of an atheist. I like Jesus and all, but I don\u2019t care too much for most of the other stuff in the Bible. Take the Disciples, for instance. They annoy the hell out of me, if you want to know the truth. They were all right after Jesus was dead and all, but while He was alive, they were about as much use to Him as a hole in the head. All they did was keep letting Him down. I like almost anybody in the Bible better than the Disciples. If you want to know the truth, the guy I like best in the Bible, next to Jesus, was that lunatic and all, that lived in the tombs and kept cutting himself with stones. I like him ten times as much as the Disciples, that poor bastard. I used to get in quite a few arguments about it, when I was at Whooton School, with this boy that lived down the corridor, Arthur Childs. Old Childs was a Quaker and all, and he read the Bible all the time. He was a very nice kid, and I liked him, but I could never see eye to eye with him on a lot of stuff in the Bible, especially the Disciples. He kept telling me if I didn\u2019t like the Disciples, then I didn\u2019t like Jesus and all. He said that because Jesus picked the Disciples, you were supposed to like them. I said I knew He picked them, but that He picked them at random. I said He didn\u2019t have time to go around analyzing everybody. I said I wasn\u2019t blaming Jesus or anything. It wasn\u2019t His fault that He didn\u2019t have any time. I remember I asked old Childs if he thought Judas, the one that betrayed Jesus and all, went to Hell after he committed suicide. Childs said certainly. That\u2019s exactly where I disagreed with him. I said I\u2019d bet a thousand bucks that Jesus never sent old Judas to Hell. I still would, too, if I had a thousand bucks. I think any one of the Disciples would\u2019ve sent him to Hell and all\\xa0\u2014 and fast, too\\xa0\u2014 but I\u2019ll bet anything Jesus didn\u2019t do it. Old Childs said the trouble with me was that I didn\u2019t go to church or anything. He was right about that, in a way. I don\u2019t. In the first place, my parents are different religions, and all the children in our family are atheists. If you want to know the truth, I can\u2019t even stand ministers. The ones they\u2019ve had at every school I\u2019ve gone to, they all have these Holy Joe voices when they start giving their sermons. God, I hate that. I don\u2019t see why the hell they can\u2019t talk in their natural voice. They sound so phony when they talk.\\nAnyway, when I was in bed, I couldn\u2019t pray worth a damn. Every time I got started, I kept picturing old Sunny calling me a crumb-bum. Finally, I sat up in bed and smoked another cigarette. It tasted lousy. I must\u2019ve smoked around two packs since I left Pencey.\\nAll of a sudden, while I was laying there smoking, somebody knocked on the door. I kept hoping it wasn\u2019t my door they were knocking on, but I knew damn well it was. I don\u2019t know how I knew, but I knew. I knew who it was, too. I\u2019m psychic.\\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I said. I was pretty scared. I\u2019m very yellow about those things.\\nThey just knocked again, though. Louder.\\nFinally I got out of bed, with just my pajamas on, and opened the door. I didn\u2019t even have to turn the light on in the room, because it was already daylight. Old Sunny and Maurice, the pimpy elevator guy, were standing there.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Wuddaya want?\u201d I said. Boy, my voice was shaking like hell.\\n\u201cNothin\u2019 much,\u201d old Maurice said. \u201cJust five bucks.\u201d He did all the talking for the two of them. Old Sunny just stood there next to him, with her mouth open and all.\\n\u201cI paid her already. I gave her five bucks. Ask her,\u201d I said. Boy, was my voice shaking.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s ten bucks, chief. I tole ya that. Ten bucks for a throw, fifteen bucks till noon. I tole ya that.\u201d\\n\u201cYou did not tell me that. You said five bucks a throw. You said fifteen bucks till noon, all right, but I distinctly heard you\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cOpen up, chief.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d I said. God, my old heart was damn near beating me out of the room. I wished I was dressed at least. It\u2019s terrible to be just in your pajamas when something like that happens.\\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, chief,\u201d old Maurice said. Then he gave me a big shove with his crumby hand. I damn near fell over on my can\\xa0\u2014 he was a huge sonuvabitch. The next thing I knew, he and old Sunny were both in the room. They acted like they owned the damn place. Old Sunny sat down on the window sill. Old Maurice sat down in the big chair and loosened his collar and all\\xa0\u2014 he was wearing this elevator operator\u2019s uniform. Boy, was I nervous.\\n\u201cAll right, chief, let\u2019s have it. I gotta get back to work.\u201d\\n\u201cI told you about ten times, I don\u2019t owe you a cent. I already gave her the five\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cCut the crap, now. Let\u2019s have it.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy should I give her another five bucks?\u201d I said. My voice was cracking all over the place. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to chisel me.\u201d\\nOld Maurice unbuttoned his whole uniform coat. All he had on underneath was a phony shirt collar, but no shirt or anything. He had a big fat hairy stomach. \u201cNobody\u2019s tryna chisel nobody,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s have it, chief.\u201d\\n\u201cNo.\u201d\\nWhen I said that, he got up from his chair and started walking towards me and all. He looked like he was very, very tired or very, very bored. God, was I scared. I sort of had my arms folded, I remember. It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, I don\u2019t think, if I hadn\u2019t had just my goddam pajamas on.\\n\u201cLet\u2019s have it, chief.\u201d He came right up to where I was standing. That\u2019s all he could say. \u201cLet\u2019s have it, chief.\u201d He was a real moron.\\n\u201cNo.\u201d\\n\u201cChief, you\u2019re gonna force me inna roughin\u2019 ya up a little bit. I don\u2019t wanna do it, but that\u2019s the way it looks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou owe us five bucks.\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t owe you five bucks,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you rough me up, I\u2019ll yell like hell. I\u2019ll wake up everybody in the hotel. The police and all.\u201d My voice was shaking like a bastard.\\n\u201cGo ahead. Yell your goddam head off. Fine,\u201d old Maurice said. \u201cWant your parents to know you spent the night with a whore? High-class kid like you?\u201d He was pretty sharp, in his crumby way. He really was.\\n\u201cLeave me alone. If you\u2019d said ten, it\u2019d be different. But you distinctly\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cAre ya gonna let us have it?\u201d He had me right up against the damn door. He was almost standing on top of me, his crumby old hairy stomach and all.\\n\u201cLeave me alone. Get the hell out of my room,\u201d I said. I still had my arms folded and all. God, what a jerk I was.\\nThen Sunny said something for the first time. \u201cHey, Maurice. Want me to get his wallet?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s right on the wutchamacallit.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah, get it.\u201d\\n\u201cLeave my wallet alone!\u201d\\n\u201cI awreddy got it,\u201d Sunny said. She waved five bucks at me. \u201cSee? All I\u2019m takin\u2019 is the five you owe me. I\u2019m no crook.\u201d\\nAll of a sudden I started to cry. I\u2019d give anything if I hadn\u2019t, but I did. \u201cNo, you\u2019re no crooks,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re just stealing five\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cShut up,\u201d old Maurice said, and gave me a shove.\\n\u201cLeave him alone, hey,\u201d Sunny said. \u201cC\u2019mon, hey. We got the dough he owes us. Let\u2019s go. C\u2019mon, hey.\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019,\u201d old Maurice said. But he didn\u2019t.\\n\u201cI mean it, Maurice, hey. Leave him alone.\u201d\\n\u201cWho\u2019s hurtin\u2019 anybody?\u201d he said, innocent as hell. Then what he did, he snapped his finger very hard on my pajamas. I won\u2019t tell you where he snapped it, but it hurt like hell. I told him he was a goddam dirty moron. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said. He put his hand behind his ear, like a deaf guy. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? What am I?\u201d\\nI was still sort of crying. I was so damn mad and nervous and all. \u201cYou\u2019re a dirty moron,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re a stupid chiseling moron, and in about two years you\u2019ll be one of those scraggy guys that come up to you on the street and ask for a dime for coffee. You\u2019ll have snot all over your dirty filthy overcoat, and you\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d\\nThen he smacked me. I didn\u2019t even try to get out of the way or duck or anything. All I felt was this terrific punch in my stomach.\\nI wasn\u2019t knocked out or anything, though, because I remember looking up from the floor and seeing them both go out the door and shut it. Then I stayed on the floor a fairly long time, sort of the way I did with Stradlater. Only, this time I thought I was dying. I really did. I thought I was drowning or something. The trouble was, I could hardly breathe. When I did finally get up, I had to walk to the bathroom all doubled up and holding onto my stomach and all.\\nBut I\u2019m crazy. I swear to God I am. About halfway to the bathroom, I sort of started pretending I had a bullet in my guts. Old Maurice had plugged me. Now I was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves and help me really go into action. I pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom, dressed and all, with my automatic in my pocket, and staggering around a little bit. Then I\u2019d walk downstairs, instead of using the elevator. I\u2019d hold onto the banister and all, with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time. What I\u2019d do, I\u2019d walk down a few floors\\xa0\u2014 holding onto my guts, blood leaking all over the place\\xa0\u2014 and then I\u2019d ring the elevator bell. As soon as old Maurice opened the doors, he\u2019d see me with the automatic in my hand and he\u2019d start screaming at me, in this very high-pitched, yellow-belly voice, to leave him alone. But I\u2019d plug him anyway. Six shots right through his fat hairy belly. Then I\u2019d throw my automatic down the elevator shaft\\xa0\u2014 after I\u2019d wiped off all the finger prints and all. Then I\u2019d crawl back to my room and call up Jane and have her come over and bandage up my guts. I pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke while I was bleeding and all.\\nThe goddam movies. They can ruin you. I\u2019m not kidding.\\nI stayed in the bathroom for about an hour, taking a bath and all. Then I got back in bed. It took me quite a while to get to sleep\\xa0\u2014 I wasn\u2019t even tired\\xa0\u2014 but finally I did. What I really felt like, though, was committing suicide. I felt like jumping out the window. I probably would\u2019ve done it, too, if I\u2019d been sure somebody\u2019d cover me up as soon as I landed. I didn\u2019t want a bunch of stupid rubbernecks looking at me when I was all gory.\\n15\\nI didn\u2019t sleep too long, because I think it was only around ten o\u2019clock when I woke up. I felt pretty hungry as soon as I had a cigarette. The last time I\u2019d eaten was those two hamburgers I had with Brossard and Ackley when we went in to Agerstown to the movies. That was a long time ago. It seemed like fifty years ago. The phone was right next to me, and I started to call down and have them send up some breakfast, but I was sort of afraid they might send it up with old Maurice. If you think I was dying to see him again, you\u2019re crazy. So I just laid around in bed for a while and smoked another cigarette. I thought of giving old Jane a buzz, to see if she was home yet and all, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood.\\nWhat I did do, I gave old Sally Hayes a buzz. She went to Mary A. Woodruff, and I knew she was home because I\u2019d had this letter from her a couple of weeks ago. I wasn\u2019t too crazy about her, but I\u2019d known her for years. I used to think she was quite intelligent, in my stupidity. The reason I did was because she knew quite a lot about the theater and plays and literature and all that stuff. If somebody knows quite a lot about those things, it takes you quite a while to find out whether they\u2019re really stupid or not. It took me years to find it out, in old Sally\u2019s case. I think I\u2019d have found it out a lot sooner if we hadn\u2019t necked so damn much. My big trouble is, I always sort of think whoever I\u2019m necking is a pretty intelligent person. It hasn\u2019t got a goddam thing to do with it, but I keep thinking it anyway.\\nAnyway, I gave her a buzz. First the maid answered. Then her father. Then she got on. \u201cSally?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYes\\xa0\u2014 who is this?\u201d she said. She was quite a little phony. I\u2019d already told her father who it was.\\n\u201cHolden Caulfield. How are ya?\u201d\\n\u201cHolden! I\u2019m fine! How are you?\u201d\\n\u201cSwell. Listen. How are ya, anyway? I mean how\u2019s school?\u201d\\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean\\xa0\u2014 you know.\u201d\\n\u201cSwell. Well, listen. I was wondering if you were busy today. It\u2019s Sunday, but there\u2019s always one or two matinees going on Sunday. Benefits and that stuff. Would you care to go?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019d love to. Grand.\u201d\\nGrand. If there\u2019s one word I hate, it\u2019s grand. It\u2019s so phony. For a second, I was tempted to tell her to forget about the matinee. But we chewed the fat for a while. That is, she chewed it. You couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise. First she told me about some Harvard guy\\xa0\u2014 it probably was a freshman, but she didn\u2019t say, naturally\\xa0\u2014 that was rushing hell out of her. Calling her up night and day. Night and day\\xa0\u2014 that killed me. Then she told me about some other guy, some West Point cadet, that was cutting his throat over her too. Big deal. I told her to meet me under the clock at the Biltmore at two o\u2019clock, and not to be late, because the show probably started at two-thirty. She was always late. Then I hung up. She gave me a pain in the ass, but she was very good-looking.\\nAfter I made the date with old Sally, I got out of bed and got dressed and packed my bag. I took a look out the window before I left the room, though, to see how all the perverts were doing, but they all had their shades down. They were the heighth of modesty in the morning. Then I went down in the elevator and checked out. I didn\u2019t see old Maurice around anywhere. I didn\u2019t break my neck looking for him, naturally, the bastard.\\nI got a cab outside the hotel, but I didn\u2019t have the faintest damn idea where I was going. I had no place to go. It was only Sunday, and I couldn\u2019t go home till Wednesday\\xa0\u2014 or Tuesday the soonest. And I certainly didn\u2019t feel like going to another hotel and getting my brains beat out. So what I did, I told the driver to take me to Grand Central Station. It was right near the Biltmore, where I was meeting Sally later, and I figured what I\u2019d do, I\u2019d check my bags in one of those strong boxes that they give you a key to, then get some breakfast. I was sort of hungry. While I was in the cab, I took out my wallet and sort of counted my money. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I had left, but it was no fortune or anything. I\u2019d spent a king\u2019s ransom in about two lousy weeks. I really had. I\u2019m a goddam spendthrift at heart. What I don\u2019t spend, I lose. Half the time I sort of even forget to pick up my change, at restaurants and night clubs and all. It drives my parents crazy. You can\u2019t blame them. My father\u2019s quite wealthy, though. I don\u2019t know how much he makes\\xa0\u2014 he\u2019s never discussed that stuff with me\\xa0\u2014 but I imagine quite a lot. He\u2019s a corporation lawyer. Those boys really haul it in. Another reason I know he\u2019s quite well off, he\u2019s always investing money in shows on Broadway. They always flop, though, and it drives my mother crazy when he does it. She hasn\u2019t felt too healthy since my brother Allie died. She\u2019s very nervous. That\u2019s another reason why I hated like hell for her to know I got the ax again.\\nAfter I put my bags in one of those strong boxes at the station, I went into this little sandwich bar and had breakfast. I had quite a large breakfast, for me\\xa0\u2014 orange juice, bacon and eggs, toast and coffee. Usually I just drink some orange juice. I\u2019m a very light eater. I really am. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so damn skinny. I was supposed to be on this diet where you eat a lot of starches and crap, to gain weight and all, but I didn\u2019t ever do it. When I\u2019m out somewhere, I generally just eat a Swiss cheese sandwich and a malted milk. It isn\u2019t much, but you get quite a lot of vitamins in the malted milk. H. V. Caulfield. Holden Vitamin Caulfield.\\nWhile I was eating my eggs, these two nuns with suitcases and all\\xa0\u2014 I guessed they were moving to another convent or something and were waiting for a train\\xa0\u2014 came in and sat down next to me at the counter. They didn\u2019t seem to know what the hell to do with their suitcases, so I gave them a hand. They were these very inexpensive-looking suitcases\\xa0\u2014 the ones that aren\u2019t genuine leather or anything. It isn\u2019t important, I know, but I hate it when somebody has cheap suitcases. It sounds terrible to say it, but I can even get to hate somebody, just looking at them, if they have cheap suitcases with them. Something happened once. For a while when I was at Elkton Hills, I roomed with this boy, Dick Slagle, that had these very inexpensive suitcases. He used to keep them under the bed, instead of on the rack, so that nobody\u2019d see them standing next to mine. It depressed holy hell out of me, and I kept wanting to throw mine out or something, or even trade with him. Mine came from Mark Cross, and they were genuine cowhide and all that crap, and I guess they cost quite a pretty penny. But it was a funny thing. Here\u2019s what happened. What I did, I finally put my suitcases under my bed, instead of on the rack, so that old Slagle wouldn\u2019t get a goddam inferiority complex about it. But here\u2019s what he did. The day after I put mine under my bed, he took them out and put them back on the rack. The reason he did it, it took me a while to find out, was because he wanted people to think my bags were his. He really did. He was a very funny guy, that way. He was always saying snotty things about them, my suitcases, for instance. He kept saying they were too new and bourgeois. That was his favorite goddam word. He read it somewhere or heard it somewhere. Everything I had was bourgeois as hell. Even my fountain pen was bourgeois. He borrowed it off me all the time, but it was bourgeois anyway. We only roomed together about two months. Then we both asked to be moved. And the funny thing was, I sort of missed him after we moved, because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he missed me, too. At first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois, and I didn\u2019t give a damn\\xa0\u2014 it was sort of funny, in fact. Then, after a while, you could tell he wasn\u2019t kidding any more. The thing is, it\u2019s really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs\\xa0\u2014 if yours are really good ones and theirs aren\u2019t. You think if they\u2019re intelligent and all, the other person, and have a good sense of humor, that they don\u2019t give a damn whose suitcases are better, but they do. They really do. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I roomed with a stupid bastard like Stradlater. At least his suitcases were as good as mine.\\nAnyway, these two nuns were sitting next to me, and we sort of struck up a conversation. The one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you see nuns and Salvation Army babes collecting dough with around Christmas time. You see them standing on corners, especially on Fifth Avenue, in front of the big department stores and all. Anyway, the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and I reached down and picked it up for her. I asked her if she was out collecting money for charity and all. She said no. She said she couldn\u2019t get it in her suitcase when she was packing it and she was just carrying it. She had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you. She had a big nose, and she had on those glasses with sort of iron rims that aren\u2019t too attractive, but she had a helluva kind face. \u201cI thought if you were taking up a collection,\u201d I told her, \u201cI could make a small contribution. You could keep the money for when you do take up a collection.\u201d\\n\u201cOh, how very kind of you,\u201d she said, and the other one, her friend, looked over at me. The other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee. It looked like a Bible, but it was too skinny. It was a Bible-type book, though. All the two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee. That depressed me. I hate it if I\u2019m eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee.\\nThey let me give them ten bucks as a contribution. They kept asking me if I was sure I could afford it and all. I told them I had quite a bit of money with me, but they didn\u2019t seem to believe me. They took it, though, finally. The both of them kept thanking me so much it was embarrassing. I swung the conversation around to general topics and asked them where they were going. They said they were schoolteachers and that they\u2019d just come from Chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on 168th Street or 186th Street or one of those streets way the hell uptown. The one next to me, with the iron glasses, said she taught English and her friend taught history and American government. Then I started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me, that taught English, thought about, being a nun and all, when she read certain books for English. Books not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them, but books with lovers and all in them. Take old Eustacia Vye, in The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy. She wasn\u2019t too sexy or anything, but even so you can\u2019t help wondering what a nun maybe thinks about when she reads about old Eustacia. I didn\u2019t say anything, though, naturally. All I said was English was my best subject.\\n\u201cOh, really? Oh, I\u2019m so glad!\u201d the one with the glasses, that taught English, said. \u201cWhat have you read this year? I\u2019d be very interested to know.\u201d She was really nice.\\n\u201cWell, most of the time we were on the Anglo-Saxons. Beowulf, and old Grendel, and Lord Randal My Son, and all those things. But we had to read outside books for extra credit once in a while. I read The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy, and Romeo and Juliet and Julius\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cOh, Romeo and Juliet! Lovely! Didn\u2019t you just love it?\u201d She certainly didn\u2019t sound much like a nun.\\n\u201cYes. I did. I liked it a lot. There were a few things I didn\u2019t like about it, but it was quite moving, on the whole.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about it? Can you remember?\u201d To tell you the truth, it was sort of embarrassing, in a way, to be talking about Romeo and Juliet with her. I mean that play gets pretty sexy in some parts, and she was a nun and all, but she asked me, so I discussed it with her for a while. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not too crazy about Romeo and Juliet,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean I like them, but\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t know. They get pretty annoying sometimes. I mean I felt much sorrier when old Mercutio got killed than when Romeo and Juliet did. The think is, I never liked Romeo too much after Mercutio gets stabbed by that other man\\xa0\u2014 Juliet\u2019s cousin\\xa0\u2014 what\u2019s his name?\u201d\\n\u201cTybalt.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Tybalt,\u201d I said\\xa0\u2014 I always forget that guy\u2019s name. \u201cIt was Romeo\u2019s fault. I mean I liked him the best in the play, old Mercutio. I don\u2019t know. All those Montagues and Capulets, they\u2019re all right\\xa0\u2014 especially Juliet\\xa0\u2014 but Mercutio, he was\\xa0\u2014 it\u2019s hard to explain. He was very smart and entertaining and all. The thing is, it drives me crazy if somebody gets killed\\xa0\u2014 especially somebody very smart and entertaining and all\\xa0\u2014 and it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s fault. Romeo and Juliet, at least it was their own fault.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat school do you go to?\u201d she asked me. She probably wanted to get off the subject of Romeo and Juliet.\\nI told her Pencey, and she\u2019d heard of it. She said it was a very good school. I let it pass, though. Then the other one, the one that taught history and government, said they\u2019d better be running along. I took their check off them, but they wouldn\u2019t let me pay it. The one with the glasses made me give it back to her.\\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been more than generous,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a very sweet boy.\u201d She certainly was nice. She reminded me a little bit of old Ernest Morrow\u2019s mother, the one I met on the train. When she smiled, mostly. \u201cWe\u2019ve enjoyed talking to you so much,\u201d she said.\\nI said I\u2019d enjoyed talking to them a lot, too. I meant it, too. I\u2019d have enjoyed it even more though, I think, if I hadn\u2019t been sort of afraid, the whole time I was talking to them, that they\u2019d all of a sudden try to find out if I was a Catholic. Catholics are always trying to find out if you\u2019re a Catholic. It happens to me a lot, I know, partly because my last name is Irish, and most people of Irish descent are Catholics. As a matter of fact, my father was a Catholic once. He quit, though, when he married my mother. But Catholics are always trying to find out if you\u2019re a Catholic even if they don\u2019t know your last name. I knew this one Catholic boy, Louis Shaney, when I was at the Whooton School. He was the first boy I ever met there. He and I were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary, the day school opened, waiting for our physicals, and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis. He was quite interested in tennis, and so was I. He told me he went to the Nationals at Forest Hills every summer, and I told him I did too, and then we talked about certain hot-shot tennis players for quite a while. He knew quite a lot about tennis, for a kid his age. He really did. Then, after a while, right in the middle of the goddam conversation, he asked me, \u201cDid you happen to notice where the Catholic church is in town, by any chance?\u201d The thing was, you could tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if I was a Catholic. He really was. Not that he was prejudiced or anything, but he just wanted to know. He was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all, but you could tell he would\u2019ve enjoyed it more if I was a Catholic and all. That kind of stuff drives me crazy. I\u2019m not saying it ruined our conversation or anything\\xa0\u2014 it didn\u2019t\\xa0\u2014 but it sure as hell didn\u2019t do it any good. That\u2019s why I was glad those two nuns didn\u2019t ask me if I was a Catholic. It wouldn\u2019t have spoiled the conversation if they had, but it would\u2019ve been different, probably. I\u2019m not saying I blame Catholics. I don\u2019t. I\u2019d be the same way, probably, if I was a Catholic. It\u2019s just like those suitcases I was telling you about, in a way. All I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s no good for a nice conversation. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\\nWhen they got up to go, the two nuns, I did something very stupid and embarrassing. I was smoking a cigarette, and when I stood up to say good-by to them, by mistake I blew some smoke in their face. I didn\u2019t mean to, but I did it. I apologized like a madman, and they were very polite and nice about it, but it was very embarrassing anyway.\\nAfter they left, I started getting sorry that I\u2019d only given them ten bucks for their collection. But the thing was, I\u2019d made that date to go to a matinee with old Sally Hayes, and I needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff. I was sorry anyway, though. Goddam money. It always ends up making you blue as hell.\\n16\\nAfter I had my breakfast, it was only around noon, and I wasn\u2019t meeting old Sally till two o\u2019clock, so I started taking this long walk. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about those two nuns. I kept thinking about that beat-up old straw basket they went around collecting money with when they weren\u2019t teaching school. I kept trying to picture my mother or somebody, or my aunt, or Sally Hayes\u2019s crazy mother, standing outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beat-up old straw basket. It was hard to picture. Not so much my mother, but those other two. My aunt\u2019s pretty charitable\\xa0\u2014 she does a lot of Red Cross work and all\\xa0\u2014 but she\u2019s very well-dressed and all, and when she does anything charitable she\u2019s always very well-dressed and has lipstick on and all that crap. I couldn\u2019t picture her doing anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she was doing it. And old Sally Hayes\u2019s mother. Jesus Christ. The only way she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her ass for her when they made a contribution. If they just dropped their dough in her basket, then walked away without saying anything to her, ignoring her and all, she\u2019d quit in about an hour. She\u2019d get bored. She\u2019d hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch. That\u2019s what I liked about those nuns. You could tell, for one thing, that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch. It made me so damn sad when I thought about it, their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything. I knew it wasn\u2019t too important, but it made me sad anyway.\\nI started walking over toward Broadway, just for the hell of it, because I hadn\u2019t been over there in years. Besides, I wanted to find a record store that was open on Sunday. There was this record I wanted to get for Phoebe, called \u201cLittle Shirley Beans.\u201d It was a very hard record to get. It was about a little kid that wouldn\u2019t go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to. I heard it at Pencey. A boy that lived on the next floor had it, and I tried to buy it off him because I knew it would knock old Phoebe out, but he wouldn\u2019t sell it. It was a very old, terrific record that this colored girl singer, Estelle Fletcher, made about twenty years ago. She sings it very Dixieland and whorehouse, and it doesn\u2019t sound at all mushy. If a white girl was singing it, she\u2019d make it sound cute as hell, but old Estelle Fletcher knew what the hell she was doing, and it was one of the best records I ever heard. I figured I\u2019d buy it in some store that was open on Sunday and then I\u2019d take it up to the park with me. It was Sunday and Phoebe goes rollerskating in the park on Sundays quite frequently. I knew where she hung out mostly.\\nIt wasn\u2019t as cold as it was the day before, but the sun still wasn\u2019t out, and it wasn\u2019t too nice for walking. But there was one nice thing. This family that you could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of me\\xa0\u2014 a father, a mother, and a little kid about six years old. They looked sort of poor. The father had on one of those pearl-gray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp. He and his wife were just walking along, talking, not paying any attention to their kid. The kid was swell. He was walking in the street, instead of on the sidewalk, but right next to the curb. He was making out like he was walking a very straight line, the way kids do, and the whole time he kept singing and humming. I got up closer so I could hear what he was singing. He was singing that song, \u201cIf a body catch a body coming through the rye.\u201d He had a pretty little voice, too. He was just singing for the hell of it, you could tell. The cars zoomed by, brakes screeched all over the place, his parents paid no attention to him, and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing \u201cIf a body catch a body coming through the rye.\u201d It made me feel better. It made me feel not so depressed any more.\\nBroadway was mobbed and messy. It was Sunday, and only about twelve o\u2019clock, but it was mobbed anyway. Everybody was on their way to the movies\\xa0\u2014 the Paramount or the Astor or the Strand or the Capitol or one of those crazy places. Everybody was all dressed up, because it was Sunday, and that made it worse. But the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies. I couldn\u2019t stand looking at them. I can understand somebody going to the movies because there\u2019s nothing else to do, but when somebody really wants to go, and even walks fast so as to get there quicker, then it depresses hell out of me. Especially if I see millions of people standing in one of those long, terrible lines, all the way down the block, waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all. Boy, I couldn\u2019t get off that goddam Broadway fast enough. I was lucky. The first record store I went into had a copy of \u201cLittle Shirley Beans.\u201d They charged me five bucks for it, because it was so hard to get, but I didn\u2019t care. Boy, it made me so happy all of a sudden. I could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old Phoebe was around so that I could give it to her.\\nWhen I came out of the record store, I passed this drugstore, and I went in. I figured maybe I\u2019d give old Jane a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet. So I went in a phone booth and called her up. The only trouble was, her mother answered the phone, so I had to hang up. I didn\u2019t feel like getting involved in a long conversation and all with her. I\u2019m not crazy about talking to girls\u2019 mothers on the phone anyway. I should\u2019ve at least asked her if Jane was home yet, though. It wouldn\u2019t have killed me. But I didn\u2019t feel like it. You really have to be in the mood for that stuff.\\nI still had to get those damn theater tickets, so I bought a paper and looked up to see what shows were playing. On account of it was Sunday, there were only about three shows playing. So what I did was, I went over and bought two orchestra seats for I Know My Love. It was a benefit performance or something. I didn\u2019t much want to see it, but I knew old Sally, the queen of the phonies, would start drooling all over the place when I told her I had tickets for that, because the Lunts were in it and all. She liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all, with the Lunts and all. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t like any shows very much, if you want to know the truth. They\u2019re not as bad as movies, but they\u2019re certainly nothing to rave about. In the first place, I hate actors. They never act like people. They just think they do. Some of the good ones do, in a very slight way, but not in a way that\u2019s fun to watch. And if any actor\u2019s really good, you can always tell he knows he\u2019s good, and that spoils it. You take Sir Laurence Olivier, for example. I saw him in Hamlet. D.B. took Phoebe and I to see it last year. He treated us to lunch first, and then he took us. He\u2019d already seen it, and the way he talked about it at lunch, I was anxious as hell to see it, too. But I didn\u2019t enjoy it much. I just don\u2019t see what\u2019s so marvelous about Sir Laurence Olivier, that\u2019s all. He has a terrific voice, and he\u2019s a helluva handsome guy, and he\u2019s very nice to watch when he\u2019s walking or dueling or something, but he wasn\u2019t at all the way D.B. said Hamlet was. He was too much like a goddam general, instead of a sad, screwed-up type guy. The best part in the whole picture was when old Ophelia\u2019s brother\\xa0\u2014 the one that gets in the duel with Hamlet at the very end\\xa0\u2014 was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice. While the father kept giving him a lot of advice, old Ophelia was sort of horsing around with her brother, taking his dagger out of the holster, and teasing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was shooting. That was nice. I got a big bang out of that. But you don\u2019t see that kind of stuff much. The only thing old Phoebe liked was when Hamlet patted this dog on the head. She thought that was funny and nice, and it was. What I\u2019ll have to do is, I\u2019ll have to read that play. The trouble with me is, I always have to read that stuff by myself. If an actor acts it out, I hardly listen. I keep worrying about whether he\u2019s going to do something phony every minute.\\nAfter I got the tickets to the Lunts\u2019 show, I took a cab up to the park. I should\u2019ve taken a subway or something, because I was getting slightly low on dough, but I wanted to get off that damn Broadway as fast as I could.\\nIt was lousy in the park. It wasn\u2019t too cold, but the sun still wasn\u2019t out, and there didn\u2019t look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of spit and cigar butts from old men, and the benches all looked like they\u2019d be wet if you sat down on them. It made you depressed, and every once in a while, for no reason, you got goose flesh while you walked. It didn\u2019t seem at all like Christmas was coming soon. It didn\u2019t seem like anything was coming. But I kept walking over to the Mall anyway, because that\u2019s where Phoebe usually goes when she\u2019s in the park. She likes to skate near the bandstand. It\u2019s funny. That\u2019s the same place I used to like to skate when I was a kid.\\nWhen I got there, though, I didn\u2019t see her around anywhere. There were a few kids around, skating and all, and two boys were playing Flys Up with a soft ball, but no Phoebe. I saw one kid about her age, though, sitting on a bench all by herself, tightening her skate. I thought maybe she might know Phoebe and could tell me where she was or something, so I went over and sat down next to her and asked her, \u201cDo you know Phoebe Caulfield, by any chance?\u201d\\n\u201cWho?\u201d she said. All she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters. You could tell her mother made them for her, because they were lumpy as hell.\\n\u201cPhoebe Caulfield. She lives on Seventy-first Street. She\u2019s in the fourth grade, over at\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou know Phoebe?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m her brother. You know where she is?\u201d\\n\u201cShe\u2019s in Miss Callon\u2019s class, isn\u2019t she?\u201d the kid said.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Yes, I think she is.\u201d\\n\u201cShe\u2019s prob\u2019ly in the museum, then. We went last Saturday,\u201d the kid said.\\n\u201cWhich museum?\u201d I asked her.\\nShe shrugged her shoulders, sort of. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThe museum.\u201d\\n\u201cI know, but the one where the pictures are, or the one where the Indians are?\u201d\\n\u201cThe one where the Indians.\u201d\\n\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I said. I got up and started to go, but then I suddenly remembered it was Sunday. \u201cThis is Sunday,\u201d I told the kid.\\nShe looked up at me. \u201cOh. Then she isn\u2019t.\u201d\\nShe was having a helluva time tightening her skate. She didn\u2019t have any gloves on or anything and her hands were all red and cold. I gave her a hand with it. Boy, I hadn\u2019t had a skate key in my hand for years. It didn\u2019t feel funny, though. You could put a skate key in my hand fifty years from now, in pitch dark, and I\u2019d still know what it is. She thanked me and all when I had it tightened for her. She was a very nice, polite little kid. God, I love it when a kid\u2019s nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or something. Most kids are. They really are. I asked her if she\u2019d care to have a hot chocolate or something with me, but she said no, thank you. She said she had to meet her friend. Kids always have to meet their friend. That kills me.\\nI took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while I walked, and put it on. I knew I wouldn\u2019t meet anybody that knew me, and it was pretty damp out. I kept walking and walking, and I kept thinking about old Phoebe going to that museum on Saturdays the way I used to. I thought how she\u2019d see the same stuff I used to see, and how she\u2019d be different every time she saw it. It didn\u2019t exactly depress me to think about it, but it didn\u2019t make me feel gay as hell, either. Certain things they should stay the way they are. You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone. I know that\u2019s impossible, but it\u2019s too bad anyway. Anyway, I kept thinking about all that while I walked.\\nI passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids on a seesaw. One of them was sort of fat, and I put my hand on the skinny kid\u2019s end, to sort of even up the weight, but you could tell they didn\u2019t want me around, so I let them alone.\\nThen a funny thing happened. When I got to the museum, all of a sudden I wouldn\u2019t have gone inside for a million bucks. It just didn\u2019t appeal to me\\xa0\u2014 and here I\u2019d walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all. If Phoebe\u2019d been there, I probably would have, but she wasn\u2019t. So all I did, in front of the museum, was get a cab and go down to the Biltmore. I didn\u2019t feel much like going. I\u2019d made that damn date with Sally, though.\\n17\\nI was way early when I got there, so I just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls. A lot of schools were home for vacation already, and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up. Girls with their legs crossed, girls with their legs not crossed, girls with terrific legs, girls with lousy legs, girls that looked like swell girls, girls that looked like they\u2019d be bitches if you knew them. It was really nice sightseeing, if you know what I mean. In a way, it was sort of depressing, too, because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them. When they got out of school and college, I mean. You figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys. Guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars. Guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf, or even just some stupid game like ping-pong. Guys that are very mean. Guys that never read books. Guys that are very boring\\xa0\u2014 but I have to be careful about that. I mean about calling certain guys bores. I don\u2019t understand boring guys. I really don\u2019t. When I was at Elkton Hills, I roomed for about two months with this boy, Harris Mackim. He was very intelligent and all, but he was one of the biggest bores I ever met. He had one of these very raspy voices, and he never stopped talking, practically. He never stopped talking, and what was awful was, he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place. But he could do one thing. The sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody I ever heard. He\u2019d be making his bed, or hanging up stuff in the closet\\xa0\u2014 he was always hanging up stuff in the closet\\xa0\u2014 it drove me crazy\\xa0\u2014 and he\u2019d be whistling while he did it, if he wasn\u2019t talking in this raspy voice. He could even whistle classical stuff, but most of the time he just whistled jazz. He could take something very jazzy, like \u201cTin Roof Blues,\u201d and whistle it so nice and easy\\xa0\u2014 right while he was hanging stuff up in the closet\\xa0\u2014 that it could kill you. Naturally, I never told him I thought he was a terrific whistler. I mean you don\u2019t just go up to somebody and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrific whistler.\u201d But I roomed with him for about two whole months, even though he bored me till I was half crazy, just because he was such a terrific whistler, the best I ever heard. So I don\u2019t know about bores. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them. They don\u2019t hurt anybody, most of them, and maybe they\u2019re secretly all terrific whistlers or something. Who the hell knows? Not me.\\nFinally, old Sally started coming up the stairs, and I started down to meet her. She looked terrific. She really did. She had on this black coat and sort of a black beret. She hardly ever wore a hat, but that beret looked nice. The funny part is, I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I\u2019m crazy. I didn\u2019t even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I swear to God I\u2019m crazy. I admit it.\\n\u201cHolden!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to see you! It\u2019s been ages.\u201d She had one of these very loud, embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere. She got away with it because she was so damn good-looking, but it always gave me a pain in the ass.\\n\u201cSwell to see you,\u201d I said. I meant it, too. \u201cHow are ya, anyway?\u201d\\n\u201cAbsolutely marvelous. Am I late?\u201d\\nI told her no, but she was around ten minutes late, as a matter of fact. I didn\u2019t give a damn, though. All that crap they have in cartoons in the Saturday Evening Post and all, showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates are late\\xa0\u2014 that\u2019s bunk. If a girl looks swell when she meets you, who gives a damn if she\u2019s late? Nobody. \u201cWe better hurry,\u201d I said. \u201cThe show starts at two-forty.\u201d We started going down the stairs to where the taxis are.\\n\u201cWhat are we going to see?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The Lunts. It\u2019s all I could get tickets for.\u201d\\n\u201cThe Lunts! Oh, marvelous!\u201d I told you she\u2019d go mad when she heard it was for the Lunts.\\nWe horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater. At first she didn\u2019t want to, because she had her lipstick on and all, but I was being seductive as hell and she didn\u2019t have any alternative. Twice, when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic, I damn near fell off the seat. Those damn drivers never even look where they\u2019re going, I swear they don\u2019t. Then, just to show you how crazy I am, when we were coming out of this big clinch, I told her I loved her and all. It was a lie, of course, but the thing is, I meant it when I said it. I\u2019m crazy. I swear to God I am.\\n\u201cOh, darling, I love you too,\u201d she said. Then, right in the same damn breath, she said, \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll let your hair grow. Crew cuts are getting corny. And your hair\u2019s so lovely.\u201d\\nLovely my ass.\\nThe show wasn\u2019t as bad as some I\u2019ve seen. It was on the crappy side, though. It was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple. It starts out when they\u2019re young and all, and the girl\u2019s parents don\u2019t want her to marry the boy, but she marries him anyway. Then they keep getting older and older. The husband goes to war, and the wife has this brother that\u2019s a drunkard. I couldn\u2019t get very interested. I mean I didn\u2019t care too much when anybody in the family died or anything. They were all just a bunch of actors. The husband and wife were a pretty nice old couple\\xa0\u2014 very witty and all\\xa0\u2014 but I couldn\u2019t get too interested in them. For one thing, they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play. Every time you saw them, some butler was shoving some tea in front of them, or the wife was pouring it for somebody. And everybody kept coming in and going out all the time\\xa0\u2014 you got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were the old couple, and they were very good, but I didn\u2019t like them much. They were different, though, I\u2019ll say that. They didn\u2019t act like people and they didn\u2019t act like actors. It\u2019s hard to explain. They acted more like they knew they were celebrities and all. I mean they were good, but they were too good. When one of them got finished making a speech, the other one said something very fast right after it. It was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all. The trouble was, it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other. They acted a little bit the way old Ernie, down in the Village, plays the piano. If you do something too good, then, after a while, if you don\u2019t watch it, you start showing off. And then you\u2019re not as good any more. But anyway, they were the only ones in the show\\xa0\u2014 the Lunts, I mean\\xa0\u2014 that looked like they had any real brains. I have to admit it.\\nAt the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette. What a deal that was. You never saw so many phonies in all your life, everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were. Some dopey movie actor was standing near us, having a cigarette. I don\u2019t know his name, but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before it\u2019s time to go over the top. He was with some gorgeous blonde, and the two of them were trying to be very blas\u00e9 and all, like as if he didn\u2019t even know people were looking at him. Modest as hell. I got a big bang out of it. Old Sally didn\u2019t talk much, except to rave about the Lunts, because she was busy rubbering and being charming. Then all of a sudden, she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby. Some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests. Strictly Ivy League. Big deal. He was standing next to the wall, smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell. Old Sally kept saying, \u201cI know that boy from somewhere.\u201d She always knew somebody, any place you took her, or thought she did. She kept saying that till I got bored as hell, and I said to her, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on over and give him a big soul kiss, if you know him? He\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d She got sore when I said that. Finally, though, the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello. You should\u2019ve seen the way they said hello. You\u2019d have thought they hadn\u2019t seen each other in twenty years. You\u2019d have thought they\u2019d taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids. Old buddyroos. It was nauseating. The funny part was, they probably met each other just once, at some phony party. Finally, when they were all done slobbering around, old Sally introduced us. His name was George something\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t even remember\\xa0\u2014 and he went to Andover. Big, big deal. You should\u2019ve seen him when old Sally asked him how he liked the play. He was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebody\u2019s question. He stepped back, and stepped right on the lady\u2019s foot behind him. He probably broke every toe in her body. He said the play itself was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. Angels. That killed me. Then he and old Sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew. It was the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life. They both kept thinking of places as fast as they could, then they\u2019d think of somebody that lived there and mention their name. I was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again. I really was. And then, when the next act was over, they continued their goddam boring conversation. They kept thinking of more places and more names of people that lived there. The worst part was, the jerk had one of those very phony, Ivy League voices, one of those very tired, snobby voices. He sounded just like a girl. He didn\u2019t hesitate to horn in on my date, the bastard. I even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over, because he walked about two blocks with us, but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails, he said. I could see them all sitting around in some bar, with their goddam checkered vests, criticizing shows and books and women in those tired, snobby voices. They kill me, those guys.\\nI sort of hated old Sally by the time we got in the cab, after listening to that phony Andover bastard for about ten hours. I was all set to take her home and all\\xa0\u2014 I really was\\xa0\u2014 but she said, \u201cI have a marvelous idea!\u201d She was always having a marvelous idea. \u201cListen,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time do you have to be home for dinner? I mean are you in a terrible hurry or anything? Do you have to be home any special time?\u201d\\n\u201cMe? No. No special time,\u201d I said. Truer word was never spoken, boy. \u201cWhy?\u201d\\n\u201cLet\u2019s go ice-skating at Radio City!\u201d\\nThat\u2019s the kind of ideas she always had.\\n\u201cIce-skating at Radio City? You mean right now?\u201d\\n\u201cJust for an hour or so. Don\u2019t you want to? If you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d I said. \u201cSure. If you want to.\u201d\\n\u201cDo you mean it? Don\u2019t just say it if you don\u2019t mean it. I mean I don\u2019t give a darn, one way or the other.\u201d\\nNot much she didn\u2019t.\\n\u201cYou can rent those darling little skating skirts,\u201d old Sally said. \u201cJeannette Cultz did it last week.\u201d\\nThat\u2019s why she was so hot to go. She wanted to see herself in one of those little skirts that just come down over their butt and all.\\nSo we went, and after they gave us our skates, they gave Sally this little blue butt-twitcher of a dress to wear. She really did look damn good in it, though. I have to admit it. And don\u2019t think she didn\u2019t know it. They kept walking ahead of me, so that I\u2019d see how cute her little ass looked. It did look pretty cute, too. I have to admit it.\\nThe funny part was, though, we were the worst skaters on the whole goddam rink. I mean the worst. And there were some lulus, too. Old Sally\u2019s ankles kept bending in till they were practically on the ice. They not only looked stupid as hell, but they probably hurt like hell, too. I know mine did. Mine were killing me. We must\u2019ve looked gorgeous. And what made it worse, there were at least a couple of hundred rubbernecks that didn\u2019t have anything better to do than stand around and watch everybody falling all over themselves.\\n\u201cDo you want to get a table inside and have a drink or something?\u201d I said to her finally.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s the most marvelous idea you\u2019ve had all day,\u201d the said. She was killing herself. It was brutal. I really felt sorry for her.\\nWe took off our goddam skates and went inside this bar where you can get drinks and watch the skaters in just your stocking feet. As soon as we sat down, old Sally took off her gloves, and I gave her a cigarette. She wasn\u2019t looking too happy. The waiter came up, and I ordered a Coke for her\\xa0\u2014 she didn\u2019t drink\\xa0\u2014 and a Scotch and soda for myself, but the sonuvabitch wouldn\u2019t bring me one, so I had a Coke, too. Then I sort of started lighting matches. I do that quite a lot when I\u2019m in a certain mood. I sort of let them burn down till I can\u2019t hold them any more, then I drop them in the ashtray. It\u2019s a nervous habit.\\nThen all of a sudden, out of a clear blue sky, old Sally said, \u201cLook. I have to know. Are you or aren\u2019t you coming over to help me trim the tree Christmas Eve? I have to know.\u201d She was still being snotty on account of her ankles when she was skating.\\n\u201cI wrote you I would. You\u2019ve asked me that about twenty times. Sure, I am.\u201d\\n\u201cI mean I have to know,\u201d she said. She started looking all around the goddam room.\\nAll of a sudden I quit lighting matches, and sort of leaned nearer to her over the table. I had quite a few topics on my mind. \u201cHey, Sally,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said. She was looking at some girl on the other side of the room.\\n\u201cDid you ever get fed up?\u201d I said. \u201cI mean did you ever get scared that everything was going to go lousy unless you did something? I mean do you like school, and all that stuff?\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrific bore.\u201d\\n\u201cI mean do you hate it? I know it\u2019s a terrific bore, but do you hate it, is what I mean.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t exactly hate it. You always have to\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cWell, I hate it. Boy, do I hate it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t just that. It\u2019s everything. I hate living in New York and all. Taxicabs, and Madison Avenue buses, with the drivers and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door, and being introduced to phony guys that call the Lunts angels, and going up and down in elevators when you just want to go outside, and guys fitting your pants all the time at Brooks, and people always\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cDon\u2019t shout, please,\u201d old Sally said. Which was very funny, because I wasn\u2019t even shouting.\\n\u201cTake cars,\u201d I said. I said it in this very quiet voice. \u201cTake most people, they\u2019re crazy about cars. They worry if they get a little scratch on them, and they\u2019re always talking about how many miles they get to a gallon, and if they get a brand-new car already they start thinking about trading it in for one that\u2019s even newer. I don\u2019t even like old cars. I mean they don\u2019t even interest me. I\u2019d rather have a goddam horse. A horse is at least human, for God\u2019s sake. A horse you can at least\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re even talking about,\u201d old Sally said. \u201cYou jump from one\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou know something?\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably the only reason I\u2019m in New York right now, or anywhere. If you weren\u2019t around, I\u2019d probably be someplace way the hell off. In the woods or some goddam place. You\u2019re the only reason I\u2019m around, practically.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re sweet,\u201d she said. But you could tell she wanted me to change the damn subject.\\n\u201cYou ought to go to a boys\u2019 school sometime. Try it sometime,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s full of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques. The guys that are on the basketball team stick together, the Catholics stick together, the goddam intellectuals stick together, the guys that play bridge stick together. Even the guys that belong to the goddam Book-of-the-Month Club stick together. If you try to have a little intelligent\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cNow, listen,\u201d old Sally said. \u201cLots of boys get more out of school than that.\u201d\\n\u201cI agree! I agree they do, some of them! But that\u2019s all I get out of it. See? That\u2019s my point. That\u2019s exactly my goddam point,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t get hardly anything out of anything. I\u2019m in bad shape. I\u2019m in lousy shape.\u201d\\n\u201cYou certainly are.\u201d\\nThen, all of a sudden, I got this idea.\\n\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cHere\u2019s my idea. How would you like to get the hell out of here? Here\u2019s my idea. I know this guy down in Greenwich Village that we can borrow his car for a couple of weeks. He used to go to the same school I did and he still owes me ten bucks. What we could do is, tomorrow morning we could drive up to Massachusetts and Vermont, and all around there, see. It\u2019s beautiful as hell up there, It really is.\u201d I was getting excited as hell, the more I thought of it, and I sort of reached over and took old Sally\u2019s goddam hand. What a goddam fool I was. \u201cNo kidding,\u201d I said. \u201cI have about a hundred and eighty bucks in the bank. I can take it out when it opens in the morning, and then I could go down and get this guy\u2019s car. No kidding. We\u2019ll stay in these cabin camps and stuff like that till the dough runs out. Then, when the dough runs out, I could get a job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and, later on, we could get married or something. I could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all. Honest to God, we could have a terrific time! Wuddaya say? C\u2019mon! Wuddaya say? Will you do it with me? Please!\u201d\\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just do something like that,\u201d old Sally said. She sounded sore as hell.\\n\u201cWhy not? Why the hell not?\u201d\\n\u201cStop screaming at me, please,\u201d she said. Which was crap, because I wasn\u2019t even screaming at her.\\n\u201cWhy can\u2019tcha? Why not?\u201d\\n\u201cBecause you can\u2019t, that\u2019s all. In the first place, we\u2019re both practically children. And did you ever stop to think what you\u2019d do if you didn\u2019t get a job when your money ran out? We\u2019d starve to death. The whole thing\u2019s so fantastic, it isn\u2019t even\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t fantastic. I\u2019d get a job. Don\u2019t worry about that. You don\u2019t have to worry about that. What\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t you want to go with me? Say so, if you don\u2019t.\u201d\\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that. It isn\u2019t that at all,\u201d old Sally said. I was beginning to hate her, in a way. \u201cWe\u2019ll have oodles of time to do those things\\xa0\u2014 all those things. I mean after you go to college and all, and if we should get married and all. There\u2019ll be oodles of marvelous places to go to. You\u2019re just\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cNo, there wouldn\u2019t be. There wouldn\u2019t be oodles of places to go to at all. It\u2019d be entirely different,\u201d I said. I was getting depressed as hell again.\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you. One minute you scream at me, and the next you\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI said no, there wouldn\u2019t be marvelous places to go to after I went to college and all. Open your ears. It\u2019d be entirely different. We\u2019d have to go downstairs in elevators with suitcases and stuff. We\u2019d have to phone up everybody and tell \u2019em good-by and send \u2019em postcards from hotels and all. And I\u2019d be working in some office, making a lot of dough, and riding to work in cabs and Madison Avenue buses, and reading newspapers, and playing bridge all the time, and going to the movies and seeing a lot of stupid shorts and coming attractions and newsreels. Newsreels. Christ almighty. There\u2019s always a dumb horse race, and some dame breaking a bottle over a ship, and some chimpanzee riding a goddam bicycle with pants on. It wouldn\u2019t be the same at all. You don\u2019t see what I mean at all.\u201d\\n\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t! Maybe you don\u2019t, either,\u201d old Sally said. We both hated each other\u2019s guts by that time. You could see there wasn\u2019t any sense trying to have an intelligent conversation. I was sorry as hell I\u2019d started it.\\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get outa here,\u201d I said. \u201cYou give me a royal pain in the ass, if you want to know the truth.\u201d\\nBoy, did she hit the ceiling when I said that. I know I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said it, and I probably wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve ordinarily, but she was depressing the hell out of me. Usually I never say crude things like that to girls. Boy, did she hit the ceiling. I apologized like a madman, but she wouldn\u2019t accept my apology. She was even crying. Which scared me a little bit, because I was a little afraid she\u2019d go home and tell her father I called her a pain in the ass. Her father was one of those big silent bastards, and he wasn\u2019t too crazy about me anyhow. He once told old Sally I was too goddam noisy.\\n\u201cNo kidding. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I kept telling her.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re sorry. You\u2019re sorry. That\u2019s very funny,\u201d she said. She was still sort of crying, and all of a sudden I did feel sort of sorry I\u2019d said it.\\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll take ya home. No kidding.\u201d\\n\u201cI can go home by myself, thank you. If you think I\u2019d let you take me home, you\u2019re mad. No boy ever said that to me in my entire life.\u201d\\nThe whole thing was sort of funny, in a way, if you thought about it, and all of a sudden I did something I shouldn\u2019t have. I laughed. And I have one of these very loud, stupid laughs. I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something, I\u2019d probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up. It made old Sally madder than ever.\\nI stuck around for a while, apologizing and trying to get her to excuse me, but she wouldn\u2019t. She kept telling me to go away and leave her alone. So finally I did it. I went inside and got my shoes and stuff, and left without her. I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve, but I was pretty goddam fed up by that time.\\nIf you want to know the truth, I don\u2019t even know why I started all that stuff with her. I mean about going away somewhere, to Massachusetts and Vermont and all. I probably wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve taken her even if she\u2019d wanted to go with me. She wouldn\u2019t have been anybody to go with. The terrible part, though, is that I meant it when I asked her. That\u2019s the terrible part. I swear to God I\u2019m a madman.\\n18\\nWhen I left the skating rink I felt sort of hungry, so I went in this drugstore and had a Swiss cheese sandwich and a malted, and then I went in a phone booth. I thought maybe I might give old Jane another buzz and see if she was home yet. I mean I had the whole evening free, and I thought I\u2019d give her a buzz and, if she was home yet, take her dancing or something somewhere. I never danced with her or anything the whole time I knew her. I saw her dancing once, though. She looked like a very good dancer. It was at this Fourth of July dance at the club. I didn\u2019t know her too well then, and I didn\u2019t think I ought to cut in on her date. She was dating this terrible guy, Al Pike, that went to Choate. I didn\u2019t know him too well, but he was always hanging around the swimming pool. He wore those white Lastex kind of swimming trunks, and he was always going off the high dive. He did the same lousy old half gainer all day long. It was the only dive he could do, but he thought he was very hot stuff. All muscles and no brains. Anyway, that\u2019s who Jane dated that night. I couldn\u2019t understand it. I swear I couldn\u2019t. After we started going around together, I asked her how come she could date a showoff bastard like Al Pike. Jane said he wasn\u2019t a show-off. She said he had an inferiority complex. She acted like she felt sorry for him or something, and she wasn\u2019t just putting it on. She meant it. It\u2019s a funny thing about girls. Every time you mention some guy that\u2019s strictly a bastard\\xa0\u2014 very mean, or very conceited and all\\xa0\u2014 and when you mention it to the girl, she\u2019ll tell you he has an inferiority complex. Maybe he has, but that still doesn\u2019t keep him from being a bastard, in my opinion. Girls. You never know what they\u2019re going to think. I once got this girl Roberta Walsh\u2019s roommate a date with a friend of mine. His name was Bob Robinson and he really had an inferiority complex. You could tell he was very ashamed of his parents and all, because they said \u201che don\u2019t\u201d and \u201cshe don\u2019t\u201d and stuff like that and they weren\u2019t very wealthy. But he wasn\u2019t a bastard or anything. He was a very nice guy. But this Roberta Walsh\u2019s roommate didn\u2019t like him at all. She told Roberta he was too conceited\\xa0\u2014 and the reason she thought he was conceited was because he happened to mention to her that he was captain of the debating team. A little thing like that, and she thought he was conceited! The trouble with girls is, if they like a boy, no matter how big a bastard he is, they\u2019ll say he has an inferiority complex, and if they don\u2019t like him, no matter how nice a guy he is, or how big an inferiority complex he has, they\u2019ll say he\u2019s conceited. Even smart girls do it.\\nAnyway, I gave old Jane a buzz again, but her phone didn\u2019t answer, so I had to hang up. Then I had to look through my address book to see who the hell might be available for the evening. The trouble was, though, my address book only has about three people in it. Jane, and this man, Mr. Antolini, that was my teacher at Elkton Hills, and my father\u2019s office number. I keep forgetting to put people\u2019s names in. So what I did finally, I gave old Carl Luce a buzz. He graduated from the Whooton School after I left. He was about three years older than I was, and I didn\u2019t like him too much, but he was one of these very intellectual guys\\xa0\u2014 he had the highest I.Q. of any boy at Whooton\\xa0\u2014 and I thought he might want to have dinner with me somewhere and have a slightly intellectual conversation. He was very enlightening sometimes. So I gave him a buzz. He went to Columbia now, but he lived on 65th Street and all, and I knew he\u2019d be home. When I got him on the phone, he said he couldn\u2019t make it for dinner but that he\u2019d meet me for a drink at ten o\u2019clock at the Wicker Bar, on 54th. I think he was pretty surprised to hear from me. I once called him a fat-assed phony.\\nI had quite a bit of time to kill till ten o\u2019clock, so what I did, I went to the movies at Radio City. It was probably the worst thing I could\u2019ve done, but it was near, and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\\nI came in when the goddam stage show was on. The Rockettes were kicking their heads off, the way they do when they\u2019re all in line with their arms around each other\u2019s waist. The audience applauded like mad, and some guy behind me kept saying to his wife, \u201cYou know what that is? That\u2019s precision.\u201d He killed me. Then, after the Rockettes, a guy came out in a tuxedo and roller skates on, and started skating under a bunch of little tables, and telling jokes while he did it. He was a very good skater and all, but I couldn\u2019t enjoy it much because I kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller-skates on the stage. It seemed so stupid. I guess I just wasn\u2019t in the right mood. Then, after him, they had this Christmas thing they have at Radio City every year. All these angels start coming out of the boxes and everywhere, guys carrying crucifixes and stuff all over the place, and the whole bunch of them\\xa0\u2014 thousands of them\\xa0\u2014 singing \u201cCome All Ye Faithful!\u201d like mad. Big deal. It\u2019s supposed to be religious as hell, I know, and very pretty and all, but I can\u2019t see anything religious or pretty, for God\u2019s sake, about a bunch of actors carrying crucifixes all over the stage. When they were all finished and started going out the boxes again, you could tell they could hardly wait to get a cigarette or something. I saw it with old Sally Hayes the year before, and she kept saying how beautiful it was, the costumes and all. I said old Jesus probably would\u2019ve puked if He could see it\\xa0\u2014 all those fancy costumes and all. Sally said I was a sacrilegious atheist. I probably am. The thing Jesus really would\u2019ve liked would be the guy that plays the kettle drums in the orchestra. I\u2019ve watched that guy since I was about eight years old. My brother Allie and I, if we were with our parents and all, we used to move our seats and go way down so we could watch him. He\u2019s the best drummer I ever saw. He only gets a chance to bang them a couple of times during a whole piece, but he never looks bored when he isn\u2019t doing it. Then when he does bang them, he does it so nice and sweet, with this nervous expression on his face. One time when we went to Washington with my father, Allie sent him a postcard, but I\u2019ll bet he never got it. We weren\u2019t too sure how to address it.\\nAfter the Christmas thing was over, the goddam picture started. It was so putrid I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off it. It was about this English guy, Alec something, that was in the war and loses his memory in the hospital and all. He comes out of the hospital carrying a cane and limping all over the place, all over London, not knowing who the hell he is. He\u2019s really a duke, but he doesn\u2019t know it. Then he meets this nice, homey, sincere girl getting on a bus. Her goddam hat blows off and he catches it, and then they go upstairs and sit down and start talking about Charles Dickens. He\u2019s both their favorite author and all. He\u2019s carrying this copy of Oliver Twist and so\u2019s she. I could\u2019ve puked. Anyway, they fell in love right away, on account of they\u2019re both so nuts about Charles Dickens and all, and he helps her run her publishing business. She\u2019s a publisher, the girl. Only, she\u2019s not doing so hot, because her brother\u2019s a drunkard and he spends all their dough. He\u2019s a very bitter guy, the brother, because he was a doctor in the war and now he can\u2019t operate any more because his nerves are shot, so he boozes all the time, but he\u2019s pretty witty and all. Anyway, old Alec writes a book, and this girl publishes it, and they both make a hatful of dough on it. They\u2019re all set to get married when this other girl, old Marcia, shows up. Marcia was Alec\u2019s fianc\u00e9e before he lost his memory, and she recognizes him when he\u2019s in this store autographing books. She tells old Alec he\u2019s really a duke and all, but he doesn\u2019t believe her and doesn\u2019t want to go with her to visit his mother and all. His mother\u2019s blind as a bat. But the other girl, the homey one, makes him go. She\u2019s very noble and all. So he goes. But he still doesn\u2019t get his memory back, even when his great Dane jumps all over him and his mother sticks her fingers all over his face and brings him this teddy bear he used to slobber around with when he was a kid. But then, one day, some kids are playing cricket on the lawn and he gets smacked in the head with a cricket ball. Then right away he gets his goddam memory back and he goes in and kisses his mother on the forehead and all. Then he starts being a regular duke again, and he forgets all about the homey babe that has the publishing business. I\u2019d tell you the rest of the story, but I might puke if I did. It isn\u2019t that I\u2019d spoil it for you or anything. There isn\u2019t anything to spoil for Chrissake. Anyway, it ends up with Alec and the homey babe getting married, and the brother that\u2019s a drunkard gets his nerves back and operates on Alec\u2019s mother so she can see again, and then the drunken brother and old Marcia go for each other. It ends up with everybody at this long dinner table laughing their asses off because the great Dane comes in with a bunch of puppies. Everybody thought it was a male, I suppose, or some goddam thing. All I can say is, don\u2019t see it if you don\u2019t want to puke all over yourself.\\nThe part that got me was, there was a lady sitting next to me that cried all through the goddam picture. The phonier it got, the more she cried. You\u2019d have thought she did it because she was kindhearted as hell, but I was sitting right next to her, and she wasn\u2019t. She had this little kid with her that was bored as hell and had to go to the bathroom, but she wouldn\u2019t take him. She kept telling him to sit still and behave himself. She was about as kindhearted as a goddam wolf. You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phony stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they\u2019re mean bastards at heart. I\u2019m not kidding.\\nAfter the movie was over, I started walking down to the Wicker Bar, where I was supposed to meet old Carl Luce, and while I walked I sort of thought about war and all. Those war movies always do that to me. I don\u2019t think I could stand it if I had to go to war. I really couldn\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t be too bad if they\u2019d just take you out and shoot you or something, but you have to stay in the Army so goddam long. That\u2019s the whole trouble. My brother D.B. was in the Army for four goddam years. He was in the war, too\\xa0\u2014 he landed on D-Day and all\\xa0\u2014 but I really think he hated the Army worse than the war. I was practically a child at the time, but I remember when he used to come home on furlough and all, all he did was lie on his bed, practically. He hardly ever even came in the living room. Later, when he went overseas and was in the war and all, he didn\u2019t get wounded or anything and he didn\u2019t have to shoot anybody. All he had to do was drive some cowboy general around all day in a command car. He once told Allie and I that if he\u2019d had to shoot anybody, he wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve known which direction to shoot in. He said the Army was practically as full of bastards as the Nazis were. I remember Allie once asked him wasn\u2019t it sort of good that he was in the war because he was a writer and it gave him a lot to write about and all. He made Allie go get his baseball mitt and then he asked him who was the best war poet, Rupert Brooke or Emily Dickinson. Allie said Emily Dickinson. I don\u2019t know too much about it myself, because I don\u2019t read much poetry, but I do know it\u2019d drive me crazy if I had to be in the Army and be with a bunch of guys like Ackley and Stradlater and old Maurice all the time, marching with them and all. I was in the Boy Scouts once, for about a week, and I couldn\u2019t even stand looking at the back of the guy\u2019s neck in front of me. They kept telling you to look at the back of the guy\u2019s neck in front of you. I swear if there\u2019s ever another war, they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad. I wouldn\u2019t object. What gets me about D.B., though, he hated the war so much, and yet he got me to read this book A Farewell to Arms last summer. He said it was so terrific. That\u2019s what I can\u2019t understand. It had this guy in it named Lieutenant Henry that was supposed to be a nice guy and all. I don\u2019t see how D.B. could hate the Army and war and all so much and still like a phony like that. I mean, for instance, I don\u2019t see how he could like a phony book like that and still like that one by Ring Lardner, or that other one he\u2019s so crazy about, The Great Gatsby. D.B. got sore when I said that, and said I was too young and all to appreciate it, but I don\u2019t think so. I told him I liked Ring Lardner and The Great Gatsby and all. I did, too. I was crazy about The Great Gatsby. Old Gatsby. Old sport. That killed me. Anyway, I\u2019m sort of glad they\u2019ve got the atomic bomb invented. If there\u2019s ever another war, I\u2019m going to sit right the hell on top of it. I\u2019ll volunteer for it, I swear to God I will.\\n19\\nIn case you don\u2019t live in New York, the Wicker Bar is in this sort of swanky hotel, the Seton Hotel. I used to go there quite a lot, but I don\u2019t any more. I gradually cut it out. It\u2019s one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all, and the phonies are coming in the window. They used to have these two French babes, Tina and Janine, come out and play the piano and sing about three times every night. One of them played the piano\\xa0\u2014 strictly lousy\\xa0\u2014 and the other one sang, and most of the songs were either pretty dirty or in French. The one that sang, old Janine, was always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang. She\u2019d say, \u201cAnd now we like to geeve you our impression of Vooly Voo Fransay. Eet ees the story of a leetle Fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety, just like New York, and falls een love wees a leetle boy from Brookleen. We hope you like eet.\u201d Then, when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell, she\u2019d sing some dopey song, half in English and half in French, and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy. If you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all, you got to hate everybody in the world, I swear you did. The bartender was a louse, too. He was a big snob. He didn\u2019t talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something. If you were a big shot or a celebrity or something, then he was even more nauseating. He\u2019d go up to you and say, with this big charming smile, like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him, \u201cWell! How\u2019s Connecticut?\u201d or \u201cHow\u2019s Florida?\u201d It was a terrible place, I\u2019m not kidding. I cut out going there entirely, gradually.\\nIt was pretty early when I got there. I sat down at the bar\\xa0\u2014 it was pretty crowded\\xa0\u2014 and had a couple of Scotch and sodas before old Luce even showed up. I stood up when I ordered them so they could see how tall I was and all and not think I was a goddam minor. Then I watched the phonies for a while. Some guy next to me was snowing hell out of the babe he was with. He kept telling her she had aristocratic hands. That killed me. The other end of the bar was full of flits. They weren\u2019t too flitty-looking\\xa0\u2014 I mean they didn\u2019t have their hair too long or anything\\xa0\u2014 but you could tell they were flits anyway. Finally old Luce showed up.\\nOld Luce. What a guy. He was supposed to be my Student Adviser when I was at Whooton. The only thing he ever did, though, was give these sex talks and all, late at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room. He knew quite a bit about sex, especially perverts and all. He was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys that go around having affairs with sheep, and guys that go around with girls\u2019 pants sewed in the lining of their hats and all. And flits and Lesbians. Old Luce knew who every flit and Lesbian in the United States was. All you had to do was mention somebody\\xa0\u2014 anybody\\xa0\u2014 and old Luce\u2019d tell you if he was a flit or not. Sometimes it was hard to believe, the people he said were flits and Lesbians and all, movie actors and like that. Some of the ones he said were flits were even married, for God\u2019s sake. You\u2019d keep saying to him, \u201cYou mean Joe Blow\u2019s a flit? Joe Blow? That big, tough guy that plays gangsters and cowboys all the time?\u201d Old Luce\u2019d say, \u201cCertainly.\u201d He was always saying \u201cCertainly.\u201d He said it didn\u2019t matter if a guy was married or not. He said half the married guys in the world were flits and didn\u2019t even know it. He said you could turn into one practically overnight, if you had all the traits and all. He used to scare the hell out of us. I kept waiting to turn into a flit or something. The funny thing about old Luce, I used to think he was sort of flitty himself, in a way. He was always saying, \u201cTry this for size,\u201d and then he\u2019d goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor. And whenever he went to the can, he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were brushing your teeth or something. That stuff\u2019s sort of flitty. It really is. I\u2019ve known quite a few real flits, at schools and all, and they\u2019re always doing stuff like that, and that\u2019s why I always had my doubts about old Luce. He was a pretty intelligent guy, though. He really was.\\nHe never said hello or anything when he met you. The first thing he said when he sat down was that he could only stay a couple of minutes. He said he had a date. Then he ordered a dry Martini. He told the bartender to make it very dry, and no olive.\\n\u201cHey, I got a flit for you,\u201d I told him. \u201cAt the end of the bar. Don\u2019t look now. I been saving him for ya.\u201d\\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d he said. \u201cSame old Caulfield. When are you going to grow up?\u201d\\nI bored him a lot. I really did. He amused me, though. He was one of those guys that sort of amuse me a lot.\\n\u201cHow\u2019s your sex life?\u201d I asked him. He hated you to ask him stuff like that.\\n\u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cJust sit back and relax, for Chrissake.\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m relaxed,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s Columbia? Ya like it?\u201d\\n\u201cCertainly I like it. If I didn\u2019t like it I wouldn\u2019t have gone there,\u201d he said. He could be pretty boring himself sometimes.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you majoring in?\u201d I asked him. \u201cPerverts?\u201d I was only horsing around.\\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you trying to be\\xa0\u2014 funny?\u201d\\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m only kidding,\u201d I said. \u201cListen, hey, Luce. You\u2019re one of these intellectual guys. I need your advice. I\u2019m in a terrific\u2014\u201d\\nHe let out this big groan on me. \u201cListen, Caulfield. If you want to sit here and have a quiet, peaceful drink and a quiet, peaceful conver\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d I said. \u201cRelax.\u201d You could tell he didn\u2019t feel like discussing anything serious with me. That\u2019s the trouble with these intellectual guys. They never want to discuss anything serious unless they feel like it. So all I did was, I started discussing topics in general with him. \u201cNo kidding, how\u2019s your sex life?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou still going around with that same babe you used to at Whooton? The one with the terriffic\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cGood God, no,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cHow come? What happened to her?\u201d\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea. For all I know, since you ask, she\u2019s probably the Whore of New Hampshire by this time.\u201d\\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t nice. If she was decent enough to let you get sexy with her all the time, you at least shouldn\u2019t talk about her that way.\u201d\\n\u201cOh, God!\u201d old Luce said. \u201cIs this going to be a typical Caulfield conversation? I want to know right now.\u201d\\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t nice anyway. If she was decent and nice enough to let you\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cMust we pursue this horrible trend of thought?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I was sort of afraid he\u2019d get up and leave on me if I didn\u2019t shut up. So all I did was, I ordered another drink. I felt like getting stinking drunk.\\n\u201cWho\u2019re you going around with now?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou feel like telling me?\u201d\\n\u201cNobody you know.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah, but who? I might know her.\u201d\\n\u201cGirl lives in the Village. Sculptress. If you must know.\u201d\\n\u201cYeah? No kidding? How old is she?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019ve never asked her, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, around how old?\u201d\\n\u201cI should imagine she\u2019s in her late thirties,\u201d old Luce said.\\n\u201cIn her late thirties? Yeah? You like that?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYou like \u2019em that old?\u201d The reason I was asking was because he really knew quite a bit about sex and all. He was one of the few guys I knew that did. He lost his virginity when he was only fourteen, in Nantucket. He really did.\\n\u201cI like a mature person, if that\u2019s what you mean. Certainly.\u201d\\n\u201cYou do? Why? No kidding, they better for sex and all?\u201d\\n\u201cListen. Let\u2019s get one thing straight. I refuse to answer any typical Caulfield questions tonight. When in hell are you going to grow up?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t say anything for a while. I let it drop for a while. Then old Luce ordered another Martini and told the bartender to make it a lot dryer.\\n\u201cListen. How long you been going around with her, this sculpture babe?\u201d I asked him. I was really interested. \u201cDid you know her when you were at Whooton?\u201d\\n\u201cHardly. She just arrived in this country a few months ago.\u201d\\n\u201cShe did? Where\u2019s she from?\u201d\\n\u201cShe happens to be from Shanghai.\u201d\\n\u201cNo kidding! She Chinese, for Chrissake?\u201d\\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\\n\u201cNo kidding! Do you like that? Her being Chinese?\u201d\\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy? I\u2019d be interested to know\\xa0\u2014 I really would.\u201d\\n\u201cI simply happen to find Eastern philosophy more satisfactory than Western. Since you ask.\u201d\\n\u201cYou do? Wuddaya mean \u2018philosophy\u2019? Ya mean sex and all? You mean it\u2019s better in China? That what you mean?\u201d\\n\u201cNot necessarily in China, for God\u2019s sake. The East I said. Must we go on with this inane conversation?\u201d\\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m serious,\u201d I said. \u201cNo kidding. Why\u2019s it better in the East?\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s too involved to go into, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d old Luce said. \u201cThey simply happen to regard sex as both a physical and a spiritual experience. If you think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cSo do I! So do I regard it as a wuddayacallit\\xa0\u2014 a physical and spiritual experience and all. I really do. But it depends on who the hell I\u2019m doing it with. If I\u2019m doing it with somebody I don\u2019t even\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cNot so loud, for God\u2019s sake, Caulfield. If you can\u2019t manage to keep your voice down, let\u2019s drop the whole\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cAll right, but listen,\u201d I said. I was getting excited and I was talking a little too loud. Sometimes I talk a little loud when I get excited. \u201cThis is what I mean, though,\u201d I said. \u201cI know it\u2019s supposed to be physical and spiritual, and artistic and all. But what I mean is, you can\u2019t do it with everybody\\xa0\u2014 every girl you neck with and all\\xa0\u2014 and make it come out that way. Can you?\u201d\\n\u201cLet\u2019s drop it,\u201d old Luce said. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d\\n\u201cAll right, but listen. Take you and this Chinese babe. What\u2019s so good about you two?\u201d\\n\u201cDrop it, I said.\u201d\\nI was getting a little too personal. I realize that. But that was one of the annoying things about Luce. When we were at Whooton, he\u2019d make you describe the most personal stuff that happened to you, but if you started asking him questions about himself, he got sore. These intellectual guys don\u2019t like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless they\u2019re running the whole thing. They always want you to shut up when they shut up, and go back to your room when they go back to their room. When I was at Whooton old Luce used to hate it\\xa0\u2014 you really could tell he did\\xa0\u2014 when after he was finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of us in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while. I mean the other guys and myself. In somebody else\u2019s room. Old Luce hated that. He always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was finished being the big shot. The thing he was afraid of, he was afraid somebody\u2019d say something smarter than he had. He really amused me.\\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go to China. My sex life is lousy,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cNaturally. Your mind is immature.\u201d\\n\u201cIt is. It really is. I know it,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know what the trouble with me is? I can never get really sexy\\xa0\u2014 I mean really sexy\\xa0\u2014 with a girl I don\u2019t like a lot. I mean I have to like her a lot. If I don\u2019t, I sort of lose my goddam desire for her and all. Boy, it really screws up my sex life something awful. My sex life stinks.\u201d\\n\u201cNaturally it does, for God\u2019s sake. I told you the last time I saw you what you need.\u201d\\n\u201cYou mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all?\u201d I said. That\u2019s what he\u2019d told me I ought to do. His father was a psychoanalyst and all.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you, for God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s none of my goddam business what you do with your life.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t say anything for a while. I was thinking.\\n\u201cSupposing I went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat would he do to me? I mean what would he do to me?\u201d\\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do a goddam thing to you. He\u2019d simply talk to you, and you\u2019d talk to him, for God\u2019s sake. For one thing, he\u2019d help you to recognize the patterns of your mind.\u201d\\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\\n\u201cThe patterns of your mind. Your mind runs in\\xa0\u2014 Listen. I\u2019m not giving an elementary course in psychoanalysis. If you\u2019re interested, call him up and make an appointment. If you\u2019re not, don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t care less, frankly.\u201d\\nI put my hand on his shoulder. Boy, he amused me. \u201cYou\u2019re a real friendly bastard,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou know that?\u201d\\nHe was looking at his wrist watch. \u201cI have to tear,\u201d he said, and stood up. \u201cNice seeing you.\u201d He got the bartender and told him to bring him his check.\\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said, just before he beat it. \u201cDid your father ever psychoanalyze you?\u201d\\n\u201cMe? Why do you ask?\u201d\\n\u201cNo reason. Did he, though? Has he?\u201d\\n\u201cNot exactly. He\u2019s helped me to adjust myself to a certain extent, but an extensive analysis hasn\u2019t been necessary. Why do you ask?\u201d\\n\u201cNo reason. I was just wondering.\u201d\\n\u201cWell. Take it easy,\u201d he said. He was leaving his tip and all and he was starting to go.\\n\u201cHave just one more drink,\u201d I told him. \u201cPlease. I\u2019m lonesome as hell. No kidding.\u201d\\nHe said he couldn\u2019t do it, though. He said he was late now, and then he left.\\nOld Luce. He was strictly a pain in the ass, but he certainly had a good vocabulary. He had the largest vocabulary of any boy at Whooton when I was there. They gave us a test.\\n20\\nI kept sitting there getting drunk and waiting for old Tina and Janine to come out and do their stuff, but they weren\u2019t there. A flitty-looking guy with wavy hair came out and played the piano, and then this new babe, Valencia, came out and sang. She wasn\u2019t any good, but she was better than old Tina and Janine, and at least she sang good songs. The piano was right next to the bar where I was sitting and all, and old Valencia was standing practically right next to me. I sort of gave her the old eye, but she pretended she didn\u2019t even see me. I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it, but I was getting drunk as hell. When she was finished, she beat it out of the room so fast I didn\u2019t even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink, so I called the headwaiter over. I told him to ask old Valencia if she\u2019d care to join me for a drink. He said he would, but he probably didn\u2019t even give her my message. People never give your message to anybody.\\nBoy, I sat at that goddam bar till around one o\u2019clock or so, getting drunk as a bastard. I could hardly see straight. The one thing I did, though, I was careful as hell not to get boisterous or anything. I didn\u2019t want anybody to notice me or anything or ask how old I was. But, boy, I could hardly see straight. When I was really drunk, I started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again. I was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts. I kept putting my hand under my jacket, on my stomach and all, to keep the blood from dripping all over the place. I didn\u2019t want anybody to know I was even wounded. I was concealing the fact that I was a wounded sonuvabitch. Finally what I felt like, I felt like giving old Jane a buzz and see if she was home yet. So I paid my check and all. Then I left the bar and went out where the telephones were. I kept keeping my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping. Boy, was I drunk.\\nBut when I got inside this phone booth, I wasn\u2019t much in the mood any more to give old Jane a buzz. I was too drunk, I guess. So what I did, I gave old Sally Hayes a buzz.\\nI had to dial about twenty numbers before I got the right one. Boy, was I blind.\\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said when somebody answered the goddam phone. I sort of yelled it, I was so drunk.\\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d this very cold lady\u2019s voice said.\\n\u201cThis is me. Holden Caulfield. Lemme speaka Sally, please.\u201d\\n\u201cSally\u2019s asleep. This is Sally\u2019s grandmother. Why are you calling at this hour, Holden? Do you know what time it is?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah. Wanna talka Sally. Very important. Put her on.\u201d\\n\u201cSally\u2019s asleep, young man. Call her tomorrow. Good night.\u201d\\n\u201cWake \u2019er up! Wake \u2019er up, hey. Attaboy.\u201d\\nThen there was a different voice. \u201cHolden, this is me.\u201d It was old Sally. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea?\u201d\\n\u201cSally? That you?\u201d\\n\u201cYes\\xa0\u2014 stop screaming. Are you drunk?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah. Listen. Listen, hey. I\u2019ll come over Christmas Eve. Okay? Trimma goddam tree for ya. Okay? Okay, hey, Sally?\u201d\\n\u201cYes. You\u2019re drunk. Go to bed now. Where are you? Who\u2019s with you?\u201d\\n\u201cSally? I\u2019ll come over and trimma tree for ya, okay? Okay, hey?\u201d\\n\u201cYes. Go to bed now. Where are you? Who\u2019s with you?\u201d\\n\u201cNobody. Me, myself and I.\u201d Boy was I drunk! I was even still holding onto my guts. \u201cThey got me. Rocky\u2019s mob got me. You know that? Sally, you know that?\u201d\\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you. Go to bed now. I have to go. Call me tomorrow.\u201d\\n\u201cHey, Sally! You want me trimma tree for ya? Ya want me to? Huh?\u201d\\n\u201cYes. Good night. Go home and go to bed.\u201d\\nShe hung up on me.\\n\u201cG\u2019night. G\u2019night, Sally baby. Sally sweetheart darling,\u201d I said. Can you imagine how drunk I was? I hung up too, then. I figured she probably just came home from a date. I pictured her out with the Lunts and all somewhere, and that Andover jerk. All of them swimming around in a goddam pot of tea and saying sophisticated stuff to each other and being charming and phony. I wished to God I hadn\u2019t even phoned her. When I\u2019m drunk, I\u2019m a madman.\\nI stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while. I kept holding onto the phone, sort of, so I wouldn\u2019t pass out. I wasn\u2019t feeling too marvelous, to tell you the truth. Finally, though, I came out and went in the men\u2019s room, staggering around like a moron, and filled one of the washbowls with cold water. Then I dunked my head in it, right up to the ears. I didn\u2019t even bother to dry it or anything. I just let the sonuvabitch drip. Then I walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it. It was nice and warm. It felt good because I was shivering like a bastard. It\u2019s a funny thing, I always shiver like hell when I\u2019m drunk.\\nI didn\u2019t have anything else to do, so I kept sitting on the radiator and counting these little white squares on the floor. I was getting soaked. About a gallon of water was dripping down my neck, getting all over my collar and tie and all, but I didn\u2019t give a damn. I was too drunk to give a damn. Then, pretty soon, the guy that played the piano for old Valencia, this very wavyhaired, flitty-looking guy, came in to comb his golden locks. We sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing it, except that he wasn\u2019t too goddam friendly.\\n\u201cHey. You gonna see that Valencia babe when you go back in the bar?\u201d I asked him.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly probable,\u201d he said. Witty bastard. All I ever meet is witty bastards.\\n\u201cListen. Give her my compliments. Ask her if that goddam waiter gave her my message, willya?\u201d\\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home, Mac? How old are you, anyway?\u201d\\n\u201cEighty-six. Listen. Give her my compliments. Okay?\u201d\\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home, Mac?\u201d\\n\u201cNot me. Boy, you can play that goddam piano.\u201d I told him. I was just flattering him. He played the piano stinking, if you want to know the truth. \u201cYou oughta go on the radio,\u201d I said. \u201cHandsome chap like you. All those goddam golden locks. Ya need a manager?\u201d\\n\u201cGo home, Mac, like a good guy. Go home and hit the sack.\u201d\\n\u201cNo home to go to. No kidding\\xa0\u2014 you need a manager?\u201d\\nHe didn\u2019t answer me. He just went out. He was all through combing his hair and patting it and all, so he left. Like Stradlater. All these handsome guys are the same. When they\u2019re done combing their goddam hair, they beat it on you.\\nWhen I finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat-check room, I was crying and all. I don\u2019t know why, but I was. I guess it was because I was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome. Then, when I went out to the checkroom, I couldn\u2019t find my goddam check. The hat-check girl was very nice about it, though. She gave me my coat anyway. And my \u201cLittle Shirley Beans\u201d record\\xa0\u2014 I still had it with me and all. I gave her a buck for being so nice, but she wouldn\u2019t take it. She kept telling me to go home and go to bed. I sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working, but she wouldn\u2019t do it. She said she was old enough to be my mother and all. I showed her my goddam gray hair and told her I was forty-two\\xa0\u2014 I was only horsing around, naturally. She was nice, though. I showed her my goddam red hunting hat, and she liked it. She made me put it on before I went out, because my hair was still pretty wet. She was all right.\\nI didn\u2019t feel too drunk any more when I went outside, but it was getting very cold out again, and my teeth started chattering like hell. I couldn\u2019t make them stop. I walked over to Madison Avenue and started to wait around for a bus because I didn\u2019t have hardly any money left and I had to start economizing on cabs and all. But I didn\u2019t feel like getting on a damn bus. And besides, I didn\u2019t even know where I was supposed to go. So what I did, I started walking over to the park. I figured I\u2019d go by that little lake and see what the hell the ducks were doing, see if they were around or not, I still didn\u2019t know if they were around or not. It wasn\u2019t far over to the park, and I didn\u2019t have anyplace else special to go to\\xa0\u2014 I didn\u2019t even know where I was going to sleep yet\\xa0\u2014 so I went. I wasn\u2019t tired or anything. I just felt blue as hell.\\nThen something terrible happened just as I got in the park. I dropped old Phoebe\u2019s record. It broke into about fifty pieces. It was in a big envelope and all, but it broke anyway. I damn near cried, it made me feel so terrible, but all I did was, I took the pieces out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket. They weren\u2019t any good for anything, but I didn\u2019t feel like just throwing them away. Then I went in the park. Boy, was it dark.\\nI\u2019ve lived in New York all my life, and I know Central Park like the back of my hand, because I used to roller-skate there all the time and ride my bike when I was a kid, but I had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night. I knew right where it was\\xa0\u2014 it was right near Central Park South and all\\xa0\u2014 but I still couldn\u2019t find it. I must\u2019ve been drunker than I thought. I kept walking and walking, and it kept getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier. I didn\u2019t see one person the whole time I was in the park. I\u2019m just as glad. I probably would\u2019ve jumped about a mile if I had. Then, finally, I found it. What it was, it was partly frozen and partly not frozen. But I didn\u2019t see any ducks around. I walked all around the whole damn lake\\xa0\u2014 I damn near fell in once, in fact\\xa0\u2014 but I didn\u2019t see a single duck. I thought maybe if there were any around, they might be asleep or something near the edge of the water, near the grass and all. That\u2019s how I nearly fell in. But I couldn\u2019t find any.\\nFinally I sat down on this bench, where it wasn\u2019t so goddam dark. Boy, I was still shivering like a bastard, and the back of my hair, even though I had my hunting hat on, was sort of full of little hunks of ice. That worried me. I thought probably I\u2019d get pneumonia and die. I started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all. My grandfather from Detroit, that keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you ride on a goddam bus with him, and my aunts\\xa0\u2014 I have about fifty aunts\\xa0\u2014 and all my lousy cousins. What a mob\u2019d be there. They all came when Allie died, the whole goddam stupid bunch of them. I have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there, D.B. told me. I wasn\u2019t there. I was still in the hospital. I had to go to the hospital and all after I hurt my hand. Anyway, I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia, with all those hunks of ice in my hair, and that I was going to die. I felt sorry as hell for my mother and father. Especially my mother, because she still isn\u2019t over my brother Allie yet. I kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suits and athletic equipment and all. The only good thing, I knew she wouldn\u2019t let old Phoebe come to my goddam funeral because she was only a little kid. That was the only good part. Then I thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam cemetery and all, with my name on this tombstone and all. Surrounded by dead guys. Boy, when you\u2019re dead, they really fix you up. I hope to hell when I do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something. Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery. People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday, and all that crap. Who wants flowers when you\u2019re dead? Nobody.\\nWhen the weather\u2019s nice, my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old Allie\u2019s grave. I went with them a couple of times, but I cut it out. In the first place, I certainly don\u2019t enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery. Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all. It wasn\u2019t too bad when the sun was out, but twice\\xa0\u2014 twice\\xa0\u2014 we were there when it started to rain. It was awful. It rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained all over the place. All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars. That\u2019s what nearly drove me crazy. All the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinner\\xa0\u2014 everybody except Allie. I couldn\u2019t stand it. I know it\u2019s only his body and all that\u2019s in the cemetery, and his soul\u2019s in Heaven and all that crap, but I couldn\u2019t stand it anyway. I just wish he wasn\u2019t there. You didn\u2019t know him. If you\u2019d known him, you\u2019d know what I mean. It\u2019s not too bad when the sun\u2019s out, but the sun only comes out when it feels like coming out.\\nAfter a while, just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all, I took out my dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp. All I had was three singles and five quarters and a nickel left\\xa0\u2014 boy, I spent a fortune since I left Pencey. Then what I did, I went down near the lagoon and I sort of skipped the quarters and the nickel across it, where it wasn\u2019t frozen. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I did it. I guess I thought it\u2019d take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying. It didn\u2019t, though.\\nI started thinking how old Phoebe would feel if I got pneumonia and died. It was a childish way to think, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself. She\u2019d feel pretty bad if something like that happened. She likes me a lot. I mean she\u2019s quite fond of me. She really is. Anyway, I couldn\u2019t get that off my mind, so finally what I figured I\u2019d do, I figured I\u2019d better sneak home and see her, in case I died and all. I had my door key with me and all, and I figured what I\u2019d do, I\u2019d sneak in the apartment, very quiet and all, and just sort of chew the fat with her for a while. The only thing that worried me was our front door. It creaks like a bastard. It\u2019s a pretty old apartment house, and the superintendent\u2019s a lazy bastard, and everything creaks and squeaks. I was afraid my parents might hear me sneaking in. But I decided I\u2019d try it anyhow.\\nSo I got the hell out of the park, and went home. I walked all the way. It wasn\u2019t too far, and I wasn\u2019t tired or even drunk any more. It was just very cold and nobody around anywhere.\\n21\\nThe best break I had in years, when I got home the regular night elevator boy, Pete, wasn\u2019t on the car. Some new guy I\u2019d never seen was on the car, so I figured that if I didn\u2019t bump smack into my parents and all I\u2019d be able to say hello to old Phoebe and then beat it and nobody\u2019d even know I\u2019d been around. It was really a terrific break. What made it even better, the new elevator boy was sort of on the stupid side. I told him, in this very casual voice, to take me up to the Dicksteins\u2019. The Dicksteins were these people that had the other apartment on our floor. I\u2019d already taken off my hunting hat, so as not to look suspicious or anything. I went in the elevator like I was in a terrific hurry.\\nHe had the elevator doors all shut and all, and was all set to take me up, and then he turned around and said, \u201cThey ain\u2019t in. They\u2019re at a party on the fourteenth floor.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to wait for them. I\u2019m their nephew.\u201d\\nHe gave me this sort of stupid, suspicious look. \u201cYou better wait in the lobby, fella,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cI\u2019d like to\\xa0\u2014 I really would,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I have a bad leg. I have to hold it in a certain position. I think I\u2019d better sit down in the chair outside their door.\u201d\\nHe didn\u2019t know what the hell I was talking about, so all he said was \u201cOh\u201d and took me up. Not bad, boy. It\u2019s funny. All you have to do is say something nobody understands and they\u2019ll do practically anything you want them to.\\nI got off at our floor\\xa0\u2014 limping like a bastard\\xa0\u2014 and started walking over toward the Dicksteins\u2019 side. Then, when I heard the elevator doors shut, I turned around and went over to our side. I was doing all right. I didn\u2019t even feel drunk anymore. Then I took out my door key and opened our door, quiet as hell. Then, very, very carefully and all, I went inside and closed the door. I really should\u2019ve been a crook.\\nIt was dark as hell in the foyer, naturally, and naturally I couldn\u2019t turn on any lights. I had to be careful not to bump into anything and make a racket. I certainly knew I was home, though. Our foyer has a funny smell that doesn\u2019t smell like anyplace else. I don\u2019t know what the hell it is. It isn\u2019t cauliflower and it isn\u2019t perfume\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t know what the hell it is\\xa0\u2014 but you always know you\u2019re home. I started to take off my coat and hang it up in the foyer closet, but that closet\u2019s full of hangers that rattle like madmen when you open the door, so I left it on. Then I started walking very, very slowly back toward old Phoebe\u2019s room. I knew the maid wouldn\u2019t hear me because she had only one eardrum. She had this brother that stuck a straw down her ear when she was a kid, she once told me. She was pretty deaf and all. But my parents, especially my mother, she has ears like a goddam bloodhound. So I took it very, very easy when I went past their door. I even held my breath, for God\u2019s sake. You can hit my father over the head with a chair and he won\u2019t wake up, but my mother, all you have to do to my mother is cough somewhere in Siberia and she\u2019ll hear you. She\u2019s nervous as hell. Half the time she\u2019s up all night smoking cigarettes.\\nFinally, after about an hour, I got to old Phoebe\u2019s room. She wasn\u2019t there, though. I forgot about that. I forgot she always sleeps in D.B.\u2019s room when he\u2019s away in Hollywood or some place. She likes it because it\u2019s the biggest room in the house. Also because it has this big old madman desk in it that D.B. bought off some lady alcoholic in Philadelphia, and this big, gigantic bed that\u2019s about ten miles wide and ten miles long. I don\u2019t know where he bought that bed. Anyway, old Phoebe likes to sleep in D.B.\u2019s room when he\u2019s away, and he lets her. You ought to see her doing her homework or something at that crazy desk. It\u2019s almost as big as the bed. You can hardly see her when she\u2019s doing her homework. That\u2019s the kind of stuff she likes, though. She doesn\u2019t like her own room because it\u2019s too little, she says. She says she likes to spread out. That kills me. What\u2019s old Phoebe got to spread out? Nothing.\\nAnyway, I went into D.B.\u2019s room quiet as hell, and turned on the lamp on the desk. Old Phoebe didn\u2019t even wake up. When the light was on and all, I sort of looked at her for a while. She was laying there asleep, with her face sort of on the side of the pillow. She had her mouth way open. It\u2019s funny. You take adults, they look lousy when they\u2019re asleep and they have their mouths way open, but kids don\u2019t. Kids look all right. They can even have spit all over the pillow and they still look all right.\\nI went around the room, very quiet and all, looking at stuff for a while. I felt swell, for a change. I didn\u2019t even feel like I was getting pneumonia or anything any more. I just felt good, for a change. Old Phoebe\u2019s clothes were on this chair right next to the bed. She\u2019s very neat, for a child. I mean she doesn\u2019t just throw her stuff around, like some kids. She\u2019s no slob. She had the jacket to this tan suit my mother bought her in Canada hung up on the back of the chair. Then her blouse and stuff were on the seat. Her shoes and socks were on the floor, right underneath the chair, right next to each other. I never saw the shoes before. They were new. They were these dark brown loafers, sort of like this pair I have, and they went swell with that suit my mother bought her in Canada. My mother dresses her nice. She really does. My mother has terrific taste in some things. She\u2019s no good at buying ice skates or anything like that, but clothes, she\u2019s perfect. I mean Phoebe always has some dress on that can kill you. You take most little kids, even if their parents are wealthy and all, they usually have some terrible dress on. I wish you could see old Phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in Canada. I\u2019m not kidding.\\nI sat down on old D.B.\u2019s desk and looked at the stuff on it. It was mostly Phoebe\u2019s stuff, from school and all. Mostly books. The one on top was called Arithmetic Is Fun! I sort of opened the first page and took a look at it. This is what old Phoebe had on it:\\nPHOEBE WEATHERFIELD CAULFIELD\\n4B-1\\nThat killed me. Her middle name is Josephine, for God\u2019s sake, not Weatherfield. She doesn\u2019t like it, though. Every time I see her she\u2019s got a new middle name for herself.\\nThe book underneath the arithmetic was a geography, and the book under the geography was a speller. She\u2019s very good in spelling. She\u2019s very good in all her subjects, but she\u2019s best in spelling. Then, under the speller, there were a bunch of notebooks. She has about five thousand notebooks. You never saw a kid with so many notebooks. I opened the one on top and looked at the first page. It had on it:\\nBernice meet me at recess I have something very very important to tell you.\\nThat was all there was on that page. The next one had on it:\\nWhy has south eastern Alaska so many caning factories?\\nBecause theres so much salmon\\nWhy has it valuable forests?\\nbecause it has the right climate.\\nWhat has our government done to make\\nlife easier for the alaskan eskimos?\\nlook it up for tomorrow!!!\\nPhoebe Weatherfield Caulfield\\nPhoebe Weatherfield Caulfield\\nPhoebe Weatherfield Caulfield\\nPhoebe W. Caulfield\\nPhoebe Weatherfield Caulfield, Esq.\\nPlease pass to Shirley!!!!\\nShirley you said you were sagitarius\\nbut your only taurus bring your skates\\nwhen you come over to my house\\nI sat there on D.B.\u2019s desk and read the whole notebook. It didn\u2019t take me long, and I can read that kind of stuff, some kid\u2019s notebook, Phoebe\u2019s or anybody\u2019s, all day and all night long. Kid\u2019s notebooks kill me. Then I lit another cigarette\\xa0\u2014 it was my last one. I must\u2019ve smoked about three cartons that day. Then, finally, I woke her up. I mean I couldn\u2019t sit there on that desk for the rest of my life, and besides, I was afraid my parents might barge in on me all of a sudden and I wanted to at least say hello to her before they did. So I woke her up.\\nShe wakes up very easily. I mean you don\u2019t have to yell at her or anything. All you have to do, practically, is sit down on the bed and say, \u201cWake up, Phoeb,\u201d and bingo, she\u2019s awake.\\n\u201cHolden!\u201d she said right away. She put her arms around my neck and all. She\u2019s very affectionate. I mean she\u2019s quite affectionate, for a child. Sometimes she\u2019s even too affectionate. I sort of gave her a kiss, and she said, \u201cWhenja get home?\u201d She was glad as hell to see me. You could tell.\\n\u201cNot so loud. Just now. How are ya anyway?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Did you get my letter? I wrote you a five-page\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYeah\\xa0\u2014 not so loud. Thanks.\u201d\\nShe wrote me this letter. I didn\u2019t get a chance to answer it, though. It was all about this play she was in in school. She told me not to make any dates or anything for Friday so that I could come see it.\\n\u201cHow\u2019s the play?\u201d I asked her. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say the name of it was?\u201d\\n\u201c\u2018A Christmas Pageant for Americans.\u201d It stinks, but I\u2019m Benedict Arnold. I have practically the biggest part,\u201d she said. Boy, was she wide-awake. She gets very excited when she tells you that stuff. \u201cIt starts out when I\u2019m dying. This ghost comes in on Christmas Eve and asks me if I\u2019m ashamed and everything. You know. For betraying my country and everything. Are you coming to it?\u201d She was sitting way the hell up in the bed and all. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wrote you about. Are you?\u201d\\n\u201cSure I\u2019m coming. Certainly I\u2019m coming.\u201d\\n\u201cDaddy can\u2019t come. He has to fly to California,\u201d she said. Boy, was she wide-awake. It only takes her about two seconds to get wide-awake. She was sitting\\xa0\u2014 sort of kneeling\\xa0\u2014 way up in bed, and she was holding my goddam hand. \u201cListen. Mother said you\u2019d be home Wednesday,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said Wednesday.\u201d\\n\u201cI got out early. Not so loud. You\u2019ll wake everybody up.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat time is it? They won\u2019t be home till very late, Mother said. They went to a party in Norwalk, Connecticut,\u201d old Phoebe said. \u201cGuess what I did this afternoon! What movie I saw. Guess!\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\\xa0\u2014 Listen. Didn\u2019t they say what time they\u2019d\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cThe Doctor,\u201d old Phoebe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special movie they had at the Lister Foundation. Just this one day they had it\\xa0\u2014 today was the only day. It was all about this doctor in Kentucky and everything that sticks a blanket over this child\u2019s face that\u2019s a cripple and can\u2019t walk. Then they send him to jail and everything. It was excellent.\u201d\\n\u201cListen a second. Didn\u2019t they say what time they\u2019d\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cHe feels sorry for it, the doctor. That\u2019s why he sticks this blanket over her face and everything and makes her suffocate. Then they make him go to jail for life imprisonment, but this child that he stuck the blanket over its head comes to visit him all the time and thanks him for what he did. He was a mercy killer. Only, he knows he deserves to go to jail because a doctor isn\u2019t supposed to take things away from God. This girl in my class\u2019s mother took us. Alice Holmborg, She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s the only girl in the whole\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cWait a second, willya?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m asking you a question. Did they say what time they\u2019d be back, or didn\u2019t they?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, but not till very late. Daddy took the car and everything so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about trains. We have a radio in it now! Except that Mother said nobody can play it when the car\u2019s in traffic.\u201d\\nI began to relax, sort of. I mean I finally quit worrying about whether they\u2019d catch me home or not. I figured the hell with it. If they did, they did.\\nYou should\u2019ve seen old Phoebe. She had on these blue pajamas with red elephants on the collars. Elephants knock her out.\\n\u201cSo it was a good picture, huh?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cSwell, except Alice had a cold, and her mother kept asking her all the time if she felt grippy. Right in the middle of the picture. Always in the middle of something important, her mother\u2019d lean all over me and everything and ask Alice if she felt grippy. It got on my nerves.\u201d\\nThen I told her about the record. \u201cListen, I bought you a record,\u201d I told her. \u201cOnly I broke it on the way home.\u201d I took the pieces out of my coat pocket and showed her. \u201cI was plastered,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cGimme the pieces,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m saving them.\u201d She took them right out of my hand and then she put them in the drawer of the night table. She kills me.\\n\u201cD.B. coming home for Christmas?\u201d I asked her.\\n\u201cHe may and he may not, Mother said. It all depends. He may have to stay in Hollywood and write a picture about Annapolis.\u201d\\n\u201cAnnapolis, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a love story and everything. Guess who\u2019s going to be in it! What movie star. Guess!\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested. Annapolis, for God\u2019s sake. What\u2019s D.B. know about Annapolis, for God\u2019s sake? What\u2019s that got to do with the kind of stories he writes?\u201d I said. Boy, that stuff drives me crazy. That goddam Hollywood. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to your arm?\u201d I asked her. I noticed she had this big hunk of adhesive tape on her elbow. The reason I noticed it, her pajamas didn\u2019t have any sleeves.\\n\u201cThis boy, Curtis Weintraub, that\u2019s in my class, pushed me while I was going down the stairs in the park,\u201d she said. \u201cWanna see?\u201d She started taking the crazy adhesive tape off her arm.\\n\u201cLeave it alone. Why\u2019d he push you down the stairs?\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think he hates me,\u201d old Phoebe said. \u201cThis other girl and me, Selma Atterbury, put ink and stuff all over his windbreaker.\u201d\\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t nice. What are you\\xa0\u2014 a child, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, but every time I\u2019m in the park, he follows me everywhere. He\u2019s always following me. He gets on my nerves.\u201d\\n\u201cHe probably likes you. That\u2019s no reason to put ink all\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to like me,\u201d she said. Then she started looking at me funny. \u201cHolden,\u201d she said, \u201chow come you\u2019re not home Wednesday?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\\nBoy, you have to watch her every minute. If you don\u2019t think she\u2019s smart, you\u2019re mad.\\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re not home Wednesday?\u201d she asked me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get kicked out or anything, did you?\u201d\\n\u201cI told you. They let us out early. They let the whole\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou did get kicked out! You did!\u201d old Phoebe said. Then she hit me on the leg with her fist. She gets very fisty when she feels like it. \u201cYou did! Oh, Holden!\u201d She had her hand on her mouth and all. She gets very emotional, I swear to God.\\n\u201cWho said I got kicked out? Nobody said I\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou did. You did,\u201d she said. Then she smacked me again with her fist. If you don\u2019t think that hurts, you\u2019re crazy. \u201cDaddy\u2019ll kill you!\u201d she said. Then she flopped on her stomach on the bed and put the goddam pillow over her head. She does that quite frequently. She\u2019s a true madman sometimes.\\n\u201cCut it out, now,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna kill me. Nobody\u2019s gonna even\\xa0\u2014 C\u2019mon, Phoeb, take that goddam thing off your head. Nobody\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d\\nShe wouldn\u2019t take it off, though. You can\u2019t make her do something if she doesn\u2019t want to. All she kept saying was, \u201cDaddy\u2019s gonna kill you.\u201d You could hardly understand her with that goddam pillow over her head.\\n\u201cNobody\u2019s gonna kill me. Use your head. In the first place, I\u2019m going away. What I may do, I may get a job on a ranch or something for a while. I know this guy whose grandfather\u2019s got a ranch in Colorado. I may get a job out there,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep in touch with you and all when I\u2019m gone, if I go. C\u2019mon. Take that off your head. C\u2019mon, hey, Phoeb. Please. Please, willya?\u201d\\nShe wouldn\u2019t take it off, though I tried pulling it off, but she\u2019s strong as hell. You get tired fighting with her. Boy, if she wants to keep a pillow over her head, she keeps it. \u201cPhoebe, please. C\u2019mon outa there,\u201d I kept saying. \u201cC\u2019mon, hey\u2026 Hey, Weatherfield. C\u2019mon out.\u201d\\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out, though. You can\u2019t even reason with her sometimes. Finally, I got up and went out in the living room and got some cigarettes out of the box on the table and stuck some in my pocket. I was all out.\\n22\\nWhen I came back, she had the pillow off her head all right\\xa0\u2014 I knew she would\\xa0\u2014 but she still wouldn\u2019t look at me, even though she was laying on her back and all. When I came around the side of the bed and sat down again, she turned her crazy face the other way. She was ostracizing the hell out of me. Just like the fencing team at Pencey when I left all the goddam foils on the subway.\\n\u201cHow\u2019s old Hazel Weatherfield?\u201d I said. \u201cYou write any new stories about her? I got that one you sent me right in my suitcase. It\u2019s down at the station. It\u2019s very good.\u201d\\n\u201cDaddy\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\\nBoy, she really gets something on her mind when she gets something on her mind.\\n\u201cNo, he won\u2019t. The worst he\u2019ll do, he\u2019ll give me hell again, and then he\u2019ll send me to that goddam military school. That\u2019s all he\u2019ll do to me. And in the first place, I won\u2019t even be around. I\u2019ll be away. I\u2019ll be\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019ll probably be in Colorado on this ranch.\u201d\\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. You can\u2019t even ride a horse.\u201d\\n\u201cWho can\u2019t? Sure I can. Certainly I can. They can teach you in about two minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cStop picking at that.\u201d She was picking at that adhesive tape on her arm. \u201cWho gave you that haircut?\u201d I asked her. I just noticed what a stupid haircut somebody gave her. It was way too short.\\n\u201cNone of your business,\u201d she said. She can be very snotty sometimes. She can be quite snotty. \u201cI suppose you failed in every single subject again,\u201d she said\\xa0\u2014 very snotty. It was sort of funny, too, in a way. She sounds like a goddam schoolteacher sometimes, and she\u2019s only a little child.\\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cI passed English.\u201d Then, just for the hell of it, I gave her a pinch on the behind. It was sticking way out in the breeze, the way she was laying on her side. She has hardly any behind. I didn\u2019t do it hard, but she tried to hit my hand anyway, but she missed.\\nThen all of a sudden, she said, \u201cOh, why did you do it?\u201d She meant why did I get the ax again. It made me sort of sad, the way she said it.\\n\u201cOh, God, Phoebe, don\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m sick of everybody asking me that,\u201d I said. \u201cA million reasons why. It was one of the worst schools I ever went to. It was full of phonies. And mean guys. You never saw so many mean guys in your life. For instance, if you were having a bull session in somebody\u2019s room, and somebody wanted to come in, nobody\u2019d let them in if they were some dopey, pimply guy. Everybody was always locking their door when somebody wanted to come in. And they had this goddam secret fraternity that I was too yellow not to join. There was this one pimply, boring guy, Robert Ackley, that wanted to get in. He kept trying to join, and they wouldn\u2019t let him. Just because he was boring and pimply. I don\u2019t even feel like talking about it. It was a stinking school. Take my word.\u201d\\nOld Phoebe didn\u2019t say anything, but she was listening. I could tell by the back of her neck that she was listening. She always listens when you tell her something. And the funny part is she knows, half the time, what the hell you\u2019re talking about. She really does.\\nI kept talking about old Pencey. I sort of felt like it.\\n\u201cEven the couple of nice teachers on the faculty, they were phonies, too,\u201d I said. \u201cThere was this one old guy, Mr. Spencer. His wife was always giving you hot chocolate and all that stuff, and they were really pretty nice. But you should\u2019ve seen him when the headmaster, old Thurmer, came in the history class and sat down in the back of the room. He was always coming in and sitting down in the back of the room for about a half an hour. He was supposed to be incognito or something. After a while, he\u2019d be sitting back there and then he\u2019d start interrupting what old Spencer was saying to crack a lot of corny jokes. Old Spencer\u2019d practically kill himself chuckling and smiling and all, like as if Thurmer was a goddam prince or something.\u201d\\n\u201cDon\u2019t swear so much.\u201d\\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve made you puke, I swear it would,\u201d I said. \u201cThen, on Veterans\u2019 Day. They have this day, Veterans\u2019 Day, that all the jerks that graduated from Pencey around 1776 come back and walk all over the place, with their wives and children and everybody. You should\u2019ve seen this one old guy that was about fifty. What he did was, he came in our room and knocked on the door and asked us if we\u2019d mind if he used the bathroom. The bathroom was at the end of the corridor\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t know why the hell he asked us. You know what he said? He said he wanted to see if his initials were still in one of the can doors. What he did, he carved his goddam stupid sad old initials in one of the can doors about ninety years ago, and he wanted to see if they were still there. So my roommate and I walked him down to the bathroom and all, and we had to stand there while he looked for his initials in all the can doors. He kept talking to us the whole time, telling us how when he was at Pencey they were the happiest days of his life, and giving us a lot of advice for the future and all. Boy, did he depress me! I don\u2019t mean he was a bad guy\\xa0\u2014 he wasn\u2019t. But you don\u2019t have to be a bad guy to depress somebody\\xa0\u2014 you can be a good guy and do it. All you have to do to depress somebody is give them a lot of phony advice while you\u2019re looking for your initials in some can door\\xa0\u2014 that\u2019s all you have to do. I don\u2019t know. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if he hadn\u2019t been all out of breath. He was all out of breath from just climbing up the stairs, and the whole time he was looking for his initials he kept breathing hard, with his nostrils all funny and sad, while he kept telling Stradlater and I to get all we could out of Pencey. God, Phoebe! I can\u2019t explain. I just didn\u2019t like anything that was happening at Pencey. I can\u2019t explain.\u201d\\nOld Phoebe said something then, but I couldn\u2019t hear her. She had the side of her mouth right smack on the pillow, and I couldn\u2019t hear her.\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. \u201cTake your mouth away. I can\u2019t hear you with your mouth that way.\u201d\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like anything that\u2019s happening.\u201d\\nIt made me even more depressed when she said that.\\n\u201cYes I do. Yes I do. Sure I do. Don\u2019t say that. Why the hell do you say that?\u201d\\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t like any schools. You don\u2019t like a million things. You don\u2019t.\u201d\\n\u201cI do! That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong\\xa0\u2014 that\u2019s exactly where you\u2019re wrong! Why the hell do you have to say that?\u201d I said. Boy, was she depressing me.\\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cName one thing.\u201d\\n\u201cOne thing? One thing I like?\u201d I said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\\nThe trouble was, I couldn\u2019t concentrate too hot. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to concentrate.\\n\u201cOne thing I like a lot you mean?\u201d I asked her.\\nShe didn\u2019t answer me, though. She was in a cockeyed position way the hell over the other side of the bed. She was about a thousand miles away. \u201cC\u2019mon answer me,\u201d I said. \u201cOne thing I like a lot, or one thing I just like?\u201d\\n\u201cYou like a lot.\u201d\\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. But the trouble was, I couldn\u2019t concentrate. About all I could think of were those two nuns that went around collecting dough in those beatup old straw baskets. Especially the one with the glasses with those iron rims. And this boy I knew at Elkton Hills. There was this one boy at Elkton Hills, named James Castle, that wouldn\u2019t take back something he said about this very conceited boy, Phil Stabile. James Castle called him a very conceited guy, and one of Stabile\u2019s lousy friends went and squealed on him to Stabile. So Stabile, with about six other dirty bastards, went down to James Castle\u2019s room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back what he said, but he wouldn\u2019t do it. So they started in on him. I won\u2019t even tell you what they did to him\\xa0\u2014 it\u2019s too repulsive\\xa0\u2014 but he still wouldn\u2019t take it back, old James Castle. And you should\u2019ve seen him. He was a skinny little weak-looking guy, with wrists about as big as pencils. Finally, what he did, instead of taking back what he said, he jumped out the window. I was in the shower and all, and even I could hear him land outside. But I just thought something fell out the window, a radio or a desk or something, not a boy or anything. Then I heard everybody running through the corridor and down the stairs, so I put on my bathrobe and I ran downstairs too, and there was old James Castle laying right on the stone steps and all. He was dead, and his teeth, and blood, were all over the place, and nobody would even go near him. He had on this turtleneck sweater I\u2019d lent him. All they did with the guys that were in the room with him was expel them. They didn\u2019t even go to jail.\\nThat was about all I could think of, though. Those two nuns I saw at breakfast and this boy James Castle I knew at Elkton Hills. The funny part is, I hardly even know James Castle, if you want to know the truth. He was one of these very quiet guys. He was in my math class, but he was way over on the other side of the room, and he hardly ever got up to recite or go to the blackboard or anything. Some guys in school hardly ever get up to recite or go to the blackboard. I think the only time I ever even had a conversation with him was that time he asked me if he could borrow this turtleneck sweater I had. I damn near dropped dead when he asked me, I was so surprised and all. I remember I was brushing my teeth, in the can, when he asked me. He said his cousin was coming in to take him for a drive and all. I didn\u2019t even know he knew I had a turtleneck sweater. All I knew about him was that his name was always right ahead of me at roll call. Cabel, R., Cabel, W., Castle, Caulfield\\xa0\u2014 I can still remember it. If you want to know the truth, I almost didn\u2019t lend him my sweater. Just because I didn\u2019t know him too well.\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said to old Phoebe. She said something to me, but I didn\u2019t hear her.\\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even think of one thing.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, I can. Yes, I can.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, do it, then.\u201d\\n\u201cI like Allie,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I like doing what I\u2019m doing right now. Sitting here with you, and talking, and thinking about stuff, and\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cAllie\u2019s dead\\xa0\u2014 You always say that! If somebody\u2019s dead and everything, and in Heaven, then it isn\u2019t really\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI know he\u2019s dead! Don\u2019t you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can\u2019t I? Just because somebody\u2019s dead, you don\u2019t just stop liking them, for God\u2019s sake\\xa0\u2014 especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that\u2019re alive and all.\u201d\\nOld Phoebe didn\u2019t say anything. When she can\u2019t think of anything to say, she doesn\u2019t say a goddam word.\\n\u201cAnyway, I like it now,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean right now. Sitting here with you and just chewing the fat and horsing\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t anything really!\u201d\\n\u201cIt is so something really! Certainly it is! Why the hell isn\u2019t it? People never think anything is anything really. I\u2019m getting goddam sick of it.\u201d\\n\u201cStop swearing. All right, name something else. Name something you\u2019d like to be. Like a scientist. Or a lawyer or something.\u201d\\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be a scientist. I\u2019m no good in science.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, a lawyer\\xa0\u2014 like Daddy and all.\u201d\\n\u201cLawyers are all right, I guess\\xa0\u2014 but it doesn\u2019t appeal to me,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean they\u2019re all right if they go around saving innocent guys\u2019 lives all the time, and like that, but you don\u2019t do that kind of stuff if you\u2019re a lawyer. All you do is make a lot of dough and play golf and play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis and look like a hot-shot. And besides. Even if you did go around saving guys\u2019 lives and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys\u2019 lives, or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over, the reporters and everybody, the way it is in the dirty movies? How would you know you weren\u2019t being a phony? The trouble is, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\\nI\u2019m not too sure old Phoebe knew what the hell I was talking about. I mean she\u2019s only a little child and all. But she was listening, at least. If somebody at least listens, it\u2019s not too bad.\\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s going to kill you. He\u2019s going to kill you,\u201d she said.\\nI wasn\u2019t listening, though. I was thinking about something else\\xa0\u2014 something crazy. \u201cYou know what I\u2019d like to be?\u201d I said. \u201cYou know what I\u2019d like to be? I mean if I had my goddam choice?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat? Stop swearing.\u201d\\n\u201cYou know that song \u2018If a body catch a body comin\u2019 through the rye\u2019? I\u2019d like\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018If a body meet a body coming through the rye\u2019!\u201d old Phoebe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a poem. By Robert Burns.\u201d\\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a poem by Robert Burns.\u201d\\nShe was right, though. It is \u201cIf a body meet a body coming through the rye.\u201d I didn\u2019t know it then, though.\\n\u201cI thought it was \u2018If a body catch a body,\u2019 \u201d I said. \u201cAnyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody\u2019s around\\xa0\u2014 nobody big, I mean\\xa0\u2014 except me. And I\u2019m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff\\xa0\u2014 I mean if they\u2019re running and they don\u2019t look where they\u2019re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That\u2019s all I\u2019d do all day. I\u2019d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it\u2019s crazy, but that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d really like to be. I know it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\\nOld Phoebe didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. Then, when she said something, all she said was, \u201cDaddy\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if he does,\u201d I said. I got up from the bed then, because what I wanted to do, I wanted to phone up this guy that was my English teacher at Elkton Hills, Mr. Antolini. He lived in New York now. He quit Elkton Hills. He took this job teaching English at N.Y.U. \u201cI have to make a phone call,\u201d I told Phoebe. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t go to sleep.\u201d I didn\u2019t want her to go to sleep while I was in the living room. I knew she wouldn\u2019t but I said it anyway, just to make sure.\\nWhile I was walking toward the door, old Phoebe said, \u201cHolden!\u201d and I turned around.\\nShe was sitting way up in bed. She looked so pretty. \u201cI\u2019m taking belching lessons from this girl, Phyllis Margulies,\u201d she said. \u201cListen.\u201d\\nI listened, and I heard something, but it wasn\u2019t much. \u201cGood,\u201d I said. Then I went out in the living room and called up this teacher I had, Mr. Antolini.\\n23\\nI made it very snappy on the phone because I was afraid my parents would barge in on me right in the middle of it. They didn\u2019t, though. Mr. Antolini was very nice. He said I could come right over if I wanted to. I think I probably woke he and his wife up, because it took them a helluva long time to answer the phone. The first thing he asked me was if anything was wrong, and I said no. I said I\u2019d flunked out of Pencey, though. I thought I might as well tell him. He said \u201cGood God,\u201d when I said that. He had a good sense of humor and all. He told me to come right over if I felt like it.\\nHe was about the best teacher I ever had, Mr. Antolini. He was a pretty young guy, not much older than my brother D.B., and you could kid around with him without losing your respect for him. He was the one that finally picked up that boy that jumped out the window I told you about, James Castle. Old Mr. Antolini felt his pulse and all, and then he took off his coat and put it over James Castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary. He didn\u2019t even give a damn if his coat got all bloody.\\nWhen I got back to D.B.\u2019s room, old Phoebe\u2019d turned the radio on. This dance music was coming out. She\u2019d turned it on low, though, so the maid wouldn\u2019t hear it. You should\u2019ve seen her. She was sitting smack in the middle of the bed, outside the covers, with her legs folded like one of those Yogi guys. She was listening to the music. She kills me.\\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d I said. \u201cYou feel like dancing?\u201d I taught her how to dance and all when she was a tiny little kid. She\u2019s a very good dancer. I mean I just taught her a few things. She learned it mostly by herself. You can\u2019t teach somebody how to really dance.\\n\u201cYou have shoes on,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2019em off. C\u2019mon.\u201d\\nShe practically jumped off the bed, and then she waited while I took my shoes off, and then I danced with her for a while. She\u2019s really damn good. I don\u2019t like people that dance with little kids, because most of the time it looks terrible. I mean if you\u2019re out at a restaurant somewhere and you see some old guy take his little kid out on the dance floor. Usually they keep yanking the kid\u2019s dress up in the back by mistake, and the kid can\u2019t dance worth a damn anyway, and it looks terrible, but I don\u2019t do it out in public with Phoebe or anything. We just horse around in the house. It\u2019s different with her anyway, because she can dance. She can follow anything you do. I mean if you hold her in close as hell so that it doesn\u2019t matter that your legs are so much longer. She stays right with you. You can cross over, or do some corny dips, or even jitterbug a little, and she stays right with you. You can even tango, for God\u2019s sake.\\nWe danced about four numbers. In between numbers she\u2019s funny as hell. She stays right in position. She won\u2019t even talk or anything. You both have to stay right in position and wait for the orchestra to start playing again. That kills me. You\u2019re not supposed to laugh or anything, either.\\nAnyway, we danced about four numbers, and then I turned off the radio. Old Phoebe jumped back in bed and got under the covers. \u201cI\u2019m improving, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she asked me.\\n\u201cAnd how,\u201d I said. I sat down next to her on the bed again. I was sort of out of breath. I was smoking so damn much, I had hardly any wind. She wasn\u2019t even out of breath.\\n\u201cFeel my forehead,\u201d she said all of a sudden.\\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\\n\u201cFeel it. Just feel it once.\u201d\\nI felt it. I didn\u2019t feel anything, though.\\n\u201cDoes it feel very feverish?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cNo. Is it supposed to?\u201d\\n\u201cYes\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019m making it. Feel it again.\u201d\\nI felt it again, and I still didn\u2019t feel anything, but I said, \u201cI think it\u2019s starting to, now.\u201d I didn\u2019t want her to get a goddam inferiority complex.\\nShe nodded. \u201cI can make it go up to over the thermoneter.\u201d\\n\u201cThermometer. Who said so?\u201d\\n\u201cAlice Holmborg showed me how. You cross your legs and hold your breath and think of something very, very hot. A radiator or something. Then your whole forehead gets so hot you can burn somebody\u2019s hand.\u201d\\nThat killed me. I pulled my hand away from her forehead, like I was in terrific danger. \u201cThanks for telling me,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve burned your hand. I\u2019d\u2019ve stopped before it got too\\xa0\u2014 Shhh!\u201d Then, quick as hell, she sat way the hell up in bed.\\nShe scared hell out of me when she did that. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cThe front door!\u201d she said in this loud whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d\\nI quick jumped up and ran over and turned off the light over the desk. Then I jammed out my cigarette on my shoe and put it in my pocket. Then I fanned hell out of the air, to get the smoke out\\xa0\u2014 I shouldn\u2019t even have been smoking, for God\u2019s sake. Then I grabbed my shoes and got in the closet and shut the door. Boy, my heart was beating like a bastard.\\nI heard my mother come in the room.\\n\u201cPhoebe?\u201d she said. \u201cNow, stop that. I saw the light, young lady.\u201d\\n\u201cHello!\u201d I heard old Phoebe say. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. Did you have a good time?\u201d\\n\u201cMarvelous,\u201d my mother said, but you could tell she didn\u2019t mean it. She doesn\u2019t enjoy herself much when she goes out. \u201cWhy are you awake, may I ask? Were you warm enough?\u201d\\n\u201cI was warm enough, I just couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\\n\u201cPhoebe, have you been smoking a cigarette in here? Tell me the truth, please, young lady.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d old Phoebe said.\\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d\\n\u201cI just lit one for one second. I just took one puff. Then I threw it out the window.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy, may I ask?\u201d\\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that, Phoebe. I don\u2019t like that at all,\u201d my mother said. \u201cDo you want another blanket?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, thanks. G\u2019night!\u201d old Phoebe said. She was trying to get rid of her, you could tell.\\n\u201cHow was the movie?\u201d my mother said.\\n\u201cExcellent. Except Alice\u2019s mother. She kept leaning over and asking her if she felt grippy during the whole entire movie. We took a taxi home.\u201d\\n\u201cLet me feel your forehead.\u201d\\n\u201cI didn\u2019t catch anything. She didn\u2019t have anything. It was just her mother.\u201d\\n\u201cWell. Go to sleep now. How was your dinner?\u201d\\n\u201cLousy,\u201d Phoebe said.\\n\u201cYou heard what your father said about using that word. What was lousy about it? You had a lovely lamb chop. I walked all over Lexington Avenue just to\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cThe lamb chop was all right, but Charlene always breathes on me whenever she puts something down. She breathes all over the food and everything. She breathes on everything.\u201d\\n\u201cWell. Go to sleep. Give Mother a kiss. Did you say your prayers?\u201d\\n\u201cI said them in the bathroom. G\u2019night!\u201d\\n\u201cGood night. Go right to sleep now. I have a splitting headache,\u201d my mother said. She gets headaches quite frequently. She really does.\\n\u201cTake a few aspirins,\u201d old Phoebe said. \u201cHolden\u2019ll be home on Wednesday, won\u2019t he?\u201d\\n\u201cSo far as I know. Get under there, now. Way down.\u201d\\nI heard my mother go out and close the door. I waited a couple of minutes. Then I came out of the closet. I bumped smack into old Phoebe when I did it, because it was so dark and she was out of bed and coming to tell me. \u201cI hurt you?\u201d I said. You had to whisper now, because they were both home. \u201cI gotta get a move on,\u201d I said. I found the edge of the bed in the dark and sat down on it and started putting on my shoes. I was pretty nervous. I admit it.\\n\u201cDon\u2019t go now,\u201d Phoebe whispered. \u201cWait\u2019ll they\u2019re asleep!\u201d\\n\u201cNo. Now. Now\u2019s the best time,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be in the bathroom and Daddy\u2019ll turn on the news or something. Now\u2019s the best time.\u201d I could hardly tie my shoelaces, I was so damn nervous. Not that they would\u2019ve killed me or anything if they\u2019d caught me home, but it would\u2019ve been very unpleasant and all. \u201cWhere the hell are ya?\u201d I said to old Phoebe. It was so dark I couldn\u2019t see her.\\n\u201cHere.\u201d She was standing right next to me. I didn\u2019t even see her.\\n\u201cI got my damn bags at the station,\u201d I said. \u201cListen. You got any dough, Phoeb? I\u2019m practically broke.\u201d\\n\u201cJust my Christmas dough. For presents and all. I haven\u2019t done any shopping at all yet.\u201d\\n\u201cOh.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to take her Christmas dough.\\n\u201cYou want some?\u201d she said.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take your Christmas dough.\u201d\\n\u201cI can lend you some,\u201d she said. Then I heard her over at D.B.\u2019s desk, opening a million drawers and feeling around with her hand. It was pitch-black, it was so dark in the room. \u201cIf you go away, you won\u2019t see me in the play,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded funny when she said it.\\n\u201cYes, I will. I won\u2019t go way before that. You think I wanna miss the play?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll probably stay at Mr. Antolini\u2019s house till maybe Tuesday night. Then I\u2019ll come home. If I get a chance, I\u2019ll phone ya.\u201d\\n\u201cHere,\u201d old Phoebe said. She was trying to give me the dough, but she couldn\u2019t find my hand.\\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\\nShe put the dough in my hand.\\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t need all this,\u201d I said. \u201cJust give me two bucks, is all. No kidding\\xa0\u2014 Here.\u201d I tried to give it back to her, but she wouldn\u2019t take it.\\n\u201cYou can take it all. You can pay me back. Bring it to the play.\u201d\\n\u201cHow much is it, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d\\n\u201cEight dollars and eighty-five cents. Sixty-five cents. I spent some.\u201d\\nThen, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn\u2019t help it. I did it so nobody could hear me, but I did it. It scared hell out of old Phoebe when I started doing it, and she came over and tried to make me stop, but once you get started, you can\u2019t just stop on a goddam dime. I was still sitting on the edge of the bed when I did it, and she put her old arm around my neck, and I put my arm around her, too, but I still couldn\u2019t stop for a long time. I thought I was going to choke to death or something. Boy, I scared hell out of poor old Phoebe. The damn window was open and everything, and I could feel her shivering and all, because all she had on was her pajamas. I tried to make her get back in bed, but she wouldn\u2019t go. Finally I stopped. But it certainly took me a long, long time. Then I finished buttoning my coat and all. I told her I\u2019d keep in touch with her. She told me I could sleep with her if I wanted to, but I said no, that I\u2019d better beat it, that Mr. Antolini was waiting for me and all. Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her. She likes those kind of crazy hats. She didn\u2019t want to take it, but I made her. I\u2019ll bet she slept with it on. She really likes those kind of hats. Then I told her again I\u2019d give her a buzz if I got a chance, and then I left.\\nIt was a helluva lot easier getting out of the house than it was getting in, for some reason. For one thing, I didn\u2019t give much of a damn any more if they caught me. I really didn\u2019t. I figured if they caught me, they caught me. I almost wished they did, in a way.\\nI walked all the way downstairs, instead of taking the elevator. I went down the back stairs. I nearly broke my neck on about ten million garbage pails, but I got out all right. The elevator boy didn\u2019t even see me. He probably still thinks I\u2019m up at the Dicksteins\u2019.\\n24\\nMr. and Mrs. Antolini had this very swanky apartment over on Sutton Place, with two steps that you go down to get in the living room, and a bar and all. I\u2019d been there quite a few times, because after I left Elkton Hills Mr. Antoilni came up to our house for dinner quite frequently to find out how I was getting along. He wasn\u2019t married then. Then when he got married, I used to play tennis with he and Mrs. Antolini quite frequently, out at the West Side Tennis Club, in Forest Hills, Long Island. Mrs. Antolini, belonged there. She was lousy with dough. She was about sixty years older than Mr. Antolini, but they seemed to get along quite well. For one thing, they were both very intellectual, especially Mr. Antolini except that he was more witty than intellectual when you were with him, sort of like D.B. Mrs. Antolini was mostly serious. She had asthma pretty bad. They both read all D.B.\u2019s stories\\xa0\u2014 Mrs. Antolini, too\\xa0\u2014 and when D.B. went to Hollywood, Mr. Antolini phoned him up and told him not to go. He went anyway, though. Mr. Antolini said that anybody that could write like D.B. had no business going out to Hollywood. That\u2019s exactly what I said, practically.\\nI would have walked down to their house, because I didn\u2019t want to spend any of Phoebe\u2019s Christmas dough that I didn\u2019t have to, but I felt funny when I got outside. Sort of dizzy. So I took a cab. I didn\u2019t want to, but I did. I had a helluva time even finding a cab.\\nOld Mr. Antolini answered the door when I rang the bell\\xa0\u2014 after the elevator boy finally let me up, the bastard. He had on his bathrobe and slippers, and he had a highball in one hand. He was a pretty sophisticated guy, and he was a pretty heavy drinker. \u201cHolden, m\u2019boy!\u201d he said. \u201cMy God, he\u2019s grown another twenty inches. Fine to see you.\u201d\\n\u201cHow are you, Mr. Antolini? How\u2019s Mrs. Antolini?\u201d\\n\u201cWe\u2019re both just dandy. Let\u2019s have that coat.\u201d He took my coat off me and hung it up. \u201cI expected to see a day-old infant in your arms. Nowhere to turn. Snowflakes in your eyelashes.\u201d He\u2019s a very witty guy sometimes. He turned around and yelled out to the kitchen, \u201cLillian! How\u2019s the coffee coming?\u201d Lillian was Mrs. Antolini\u2019s first name.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s all ready,\u201d she yelled back. \u201cIs that Holden? Hello, Holden!\u201d\\n\u201cHello, Mrs. Antolini!\u201d\\nYou were always yelling when you were there. That\u2019s because the both of them were never in the same room at the same time. It was sort of funny.\\n\u201cSit down, Holden,\u201d Mr. Antolini said. You could tell he was a little oiled up. The room looked like they\u2019d just had a party. Glasses were all over the place, and dishes with peanuts in them. \u201cExcuse the appearance of the place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been entertaining some Buffalo friends of Mrs. Antolini\u2019s\u2026 Some buffaloes, as a matter of fact.\u201d\\nI laughed, and Mrs. Antolini yelled something in to me from the kitchen, but I couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d I asked Mr. Antolini.\\n\u201cShe said not to look at her when she comes in. She just arose from the sack. Have a cigarette. Are you smoking now?\u201d\\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. I took a cigarette from the box he offered me. \u201cJust once in a while. I\u2019m a moderate smoker.\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you are,\u201d he said. He gave me a light from this big lighter off the table. \u201cSo. You and Pencey are no longer one,\u201d he said. He always said things that way. Sometimes it amused me a lot and sometimes it didn\u2019t. He sort of did it a little bit too much. I don\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t witty or anything\\xa0\u2014 he was\\xa0\u2014 but sometimes it gets on your nerves when somebody\u2019s always saying things like \u201cSo you and Pencey are no longer one.\u201d D.B. does it too much sometimes, too.\\n\u201cWhat was the trouble?\u201d Mr. Antolini asked me. \u201cHow\u2019d you do in English? I\u2019ll show you the door in short order if you flunked English, you little ace composition writer.\u201d\\n\u201cOh, I passed English all right. It was mostly literature, though. I only wrote about two compositions the whole term,\u201d I said. \u201cI flunked Oral Expression, though. They had this course you had to take, Oral Expression. That I flunked.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel much like going into It. I was still feeling sort of dizzy or something, and I had a helluva headache all of a sudden. I really did. But you could tell he was interested, so I told him a little bit about it. \u201cIt\u2019s this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech. You know. Spontaneous and all. And if the boy digresses at all, you\u2019re supposed to yell \u2018Digression!\u2019 at him as fast as you can. It just about drove me crazy. I got an F in it.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don\u2019t know. The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It\u2019s more interesting and all.\u201d\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t care to have somebody stick to the point when he tells you something?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, sure! I like somebody to stick to the point and all. But I don\u2019t like them to stick too much to the point. I don\u2019t know. I guess I don\u2019t like it when somebody sticks to the point all the time. The boys that got the best marks in Oral Expression were the ones that stuck to the point all the time\\xa0\u2014 I admit it. But there was this one boy, Richard Kinsella. He didn\u2019t stick to the point too much, and they were always yelling \u2018Digression!\u2019 at him. It was terrible, because in the first place, he was a very nervous guy\\xa0\u2014 I mean he was a very nervous guy\\xa0\u2014 and his lips were always shaking whenever it was his time to make a speech, and you could hardly hear him if you were sitting way in the back of the room. When his lips sort of quit shaking a little bit, though, I liked his speeches better than anybody else\u2019s. He practically flunked the course, though, too. He got a D plus because they kept yelling \u2018Digression!\u2019 at him all the time. For instance, he made this speech about this farm his father bought in Vermont. They kept yelling \u2018Digression!\u2019 at him the whole time he was making it, and this teacher, Mr. Vinson, gave him an F on it because he hadn\u2019t told what kind of animals and vegetables and stuff grew on the farm and all. What he did was, Richard Kinsella, he\u2019d start telling you all about that stuff\\xa0\u2014 then all of a sudden he\u2019d start telling you about this letter his mother got from his uncle, and how his uncle got polio and all when he was forty-two years old, and how he wouldn\u2019t let anybody come to see him in the hospital because he didn\u2019t want anybody to see him with a brace on. It didn\u2019t have much to do with the farm\\xa0\u2014 I admit it\\xa0\u2014 but it was nice. It\u2019s nice when somebody tells you about their uncle. Especially when they start out telling you about their father\u2019s farm and then all of a sudden get more interested in their uncle. I mean it\u2019s dirty to keep yelling \u2018Digression!\u2019 at him when he\u2019s all nice and excited. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel too much like trying, either. For one thing, I had this terrific headache all of a sudden. I wished to God old Mrs. Antolini would come in with the coffee. That\u2019s something that annoys hell out of me\\xa0\u2014 I mean if somebody says the coffee\u2019s all ready and it isn\u2019t.\\n\u201cHolden\u2026 One short, faintly stuffy, pedagogical question. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a time and place for everything? Don\u2019t you think if someone starts out to tell you about his father\u2019s farm, he should stick to his guns, then get around to telling you about his uncle\u2019s brace? Or, if his uncle\u2019s brace is such a provocative subject, shouldn\u2019t he have selected it in the first place as his subject\\xa0\u2014 not the farm?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t feel much like thinking and answering and all. I had a headache and I felt lousy. I even had sort of a stomach-ache, if you want to know the truth.\\n\u201cYes\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t know. I guess he should. I mean I guess he should\u2019ve picked his uncle as a subject, instead of the farm, if that interested him most. But what I mean is, lots of time you don\u2019t know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesn\u2019t interest you most. I mean you can\u2019t help it sometimes. What I think is, you\u2019re supposed to leave somebody alone if he\u2019s at least being interesting and he\u2019s getting all excited about something. I like it when somebody gets excited about something. It\u2019s nice. You just didn\u2019t know this teacher, Mr. Vinson. He could drive you crazy sometimes, him and the goddam class. I mean he\u2019d keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time. Some things you just can\u2019t do that to. I mean you can\u2019t hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants you to. You didn\u2019t know this guy, Mr. Vinson. I mean he was very intelligent and all, but you could tell he didn\u2019t have too much brains.\u201d\\n\u201cCoffee, gentlemen, finally,\u201d Mrs. Antolini said. She came in carrying this tray with coffee and cakes and stuff on it. \u201cHolden, don\u2019t you even peek at me. I\u2019m a mess.\u201d\\n\u201cHello, Mrs. Antolini,\u201d I said. I started to get up and all, but Mr. Antolini got hold of my jacket and pulled me back down. Old Mrs. Antolini\u2019s hair was full of those iron curler jobs, and she didn\u2019t have any lipstick or anything on. She didn\u2019t look too gorgeous. She looked pretty old and all.\\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave this right here. Just dive in, you two,\u201d she said. She put the tray down on the cigarette table, pushing all these glasses out of the way. \u201cHow\u2019s your mother, Holden?\u201d\\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, thanks. I haven\u2019t seen her too recently, but the last I\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cDarling, if Holden needs anything, everything\u2019s in the linen closet. The top shelf. I\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Mrs. Antolini said. She looked it, too. \u201cCan you boys make up the couch by yourselves?\u201d\\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of everything. You run along to bed,\u201d Mr. Antolini said. He gave Mrs. Antolini a kiss and she said good-by to me and went in the bedroom. They were always kissing each other a lot in public.\\nI had part of a cup of coffee and about half of some cake that was as hard as a rock. All old Mr. Antolini had was another highball, though. He makes them strong, too, you could tell. He may get to be an alcoholic if he doesn\u2019t watch his step.\\n\u201cI had lunch with your dad a couple of weeks ago,\u201d he said all of a sudden. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d\\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re aware, of course, that he\u2019s terribly concerned about you.\u201d\\n\u201cI know it. I know he is,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cApparently before he phoned me he\u2019d just had a long, rather harrowing letter from your latest headmaster, to the effect that you were making absolutely no effort at all. Cutting classes. Coming unprepared to all your classes. In general, being an all-around\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cut any classes. You weren\u2019t allowed to cut any. There were a couple of them I didn\u2019t attend once in a while, like that Oral Expression I told you about, but I didn\u2019t cut any.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t feel at all like discussing it. The coffee made my stomach feel a little better, but I still had this awful headache.\\nMr. Antolini lit another cigarette. He smoked like a fiend. Then he said, \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know what the hell to say to you, Holden.\u201d\\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m very hard to talk to. I realize that.\u201d\\n\u201cI have a feeling that you\u2019re riding for some kind of a terrible, terrible fall. But I don\u2019t honestly know what kind\u2026 Are you listening to me?\u201d\\n\u201cYes.\u201d\\nYou could tell he was trying to concentrate and all.\\n\u201cIt may be the kind where, at the age of thirty, you sit in some bar hating everybody who comes in looking as if he might have played football in college. Then again, you may pick up just enough education to hate people who say, \u2018It\u2019s a secret between he and I.\u2019 Or you may end up in some business office, throwing paper clips at the nearest stenographer. I just don\u2019t know. But do you know what I\u2019m driving at, at all?\u201d\\n\u201cYes. Sure,\u201d I said. I did, too. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong about that hating business. I mean about hating football players and all. You really are. I don\u2019t hate too many guys. What I may do, I may hate them for a little while, like this guy Stradlater I knew at Pencey, and this other boy, Robert Ackley. I hated them once in a while\\xa0\u2014 I admit it\\xa0\u2014 but it doesn\u2019t last too long, is what I mean. After a while, if I didn\u2019t see them, if they didn\u2019t come in the room, or if I didn\u2019t see them in the dining room for a couple of meals, I sort of missed them. I mean I sort of missed them.\u201d\\nMr. Antolini didn\u2019t say anything for a while. He got up and got another hunk of ice and put it in his drink, then he sat down again. You could tell he was thinking. I kept wishing, though, that he\u2019d continue the conversation in the morning, instead of now, but he was hot. People are mostly hot to have a discussion when you\u2019re not.\\n\u201cAll right. Listen to me a minute now\u2026 I may not word this as memorably as I\u2019d like to, but I\u2019ll write you a letter about it in a day or two. Then you can get it all straight. But listen now, anyway.\u201d He started concentrating again. Then he said, \u201cThis fall I think you\u2019re riding for\\xa0\u2014 it\u2019s a special kind of fall, a horrible kind. The man falling isn\u2019t permitted to feel or hear himself hit bottom. He just keeps falling and falling. The whole arrangement\u2019s designed for men who, at some time or other in their lives, were looking for something their own environment couldn\u2019t supply them with. Or they thought their own environment couldn\u2019t supply them with. So they gave up looking. They gave it up before they ever really even got started. You follow me?\u201d\\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\\n\u201cSure?\u201d\\n\u201cYes.\u201d\\nHe got up and poured some more booze in his glass. Then he sat down again. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long time.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can very clearly see you dying nobly, one way or another, for some highly unworthy cause.\u201d He gave me a funny look. \u201cIf I write something down for you, will you read it carefully? And keep it?\u201d\\n\u201cYes. Sure,\u201d I said. I did, too. I still have the paper he gave me.\\nHe went over to this desk on the other side of the room, and without sitting down wrote something on a piece of paper. Then he came back and sat down with the paper in his hand. \u201cOddly enough, this wasn\u2019t written by a practicing poet. It was written by a psychoanalyst named Wilhelm Stekel. Here\u2019s what he\\xa0\u2014 Are you still with me?\u201d\\n\u201cYes, sure I am.\u201d\\n\u201cHere\u2019s what he said: \u2018The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\u2019 \u201d\\nHe leaned over and handed it to me. I read it right when he gave it to me, and then I thanked him and all and put it in my pocket. It was nice of him to go to all that trouble. It really was. The thing was, though, I didn\u2019t feel much like concentrating. Boy, I felt so damn tired all of a sudden.\\nYou could tell he wasn\u2019t tired at all, though. He was pretty oiled up, for one thing. \u201cI think that one of these days,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to find out where you want to go. And then you\u2019ve got to start going there. But immediately. You can\u2019t afford to lose a minute. Not you.\u201d\\nI nodded, because he was looking right at me and all, but I wasn\u2019t too sure what he was talking about. I was pretty sure I knew, but I wasn\u2019t too positive at the time. I was too damn tired.\\n\u201cAnd I hate to tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think that once you have a fair idea where you want to go, your first move will be to apply yourself in school. You\u2019ll have to. You\u2019re a student\\xa0\u2014 whether the idea appeals to you or not. You\u2019re in love with knowledge. And I think you\u2019ll find, once you get past all the Mr. Vineses and their Oral Comp\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cMr. Vinsons,\u201d I said. He meant all the Mr. Vinsons, not all the Mr. Vineses. I shouldn\u2019t have interrupted him, though.\\n\u201cAll right\\xa0\u2014 the Mr. Vinsons. Once you get past all the Mr. Vinsons, you\u2019re going to start getting closer and closer\\xa0\u2014 that is, if you want to, and if you look for it and wait for it\\xa0\u2014 to the kind of information that will be very, very dear to your heart. Among other things, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You\u2019re by no means alone on that score, you\u2019ll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You\u2019ll learn from them\\xa0\u2014 if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It\u2019s a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn\u2019t education. It\u2019s history. It\u2019s poetry.\u201d He stopped and took a big drink out of his highball. Then he started again. Boy, he was really hot. I was glad I didn\u2019t try to stop him or anything. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cthat only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world. It\u2019s not so. But I do say that educated and scholarly men, if they\u2019re brilliant and creative to begin with\\xa0\u2014 which, unfortunately, is rarely the case\\xa0\u2014 tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are merely brilliant and creative. They tend to express themselves more clearly, and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end. And\\xa0\u2014 most important\\xa0\u2014 nine times out of ten they have more humility than the unscholarly thinker. Do you follow me at all?\u201d\\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\\nHe didn\u2019t say anything again for quite a while. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever done it, but it\u2019s sort of hard to sit around waiting for somebody to say something when they\u2019re thinking and all. It really is. I kept trying not to yawn. It wasn\u2019t that I was bored or anything\\xa0\u2014 I wasn\u2019t\\xa0\u2014 but I was so damn sleepy all of a sudden.\\n\u201cSomething else an academic education will do for you. If you go along with it any considerable distance, it\u2019ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have. What it\u2019ll fit and, maybe, what it won\u2019t. After a while, you\u2019ll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing. For one thing, it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that don\u2019t suit you, aren\u2019t becoming to you. You\u2019ll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly.\u201d\\nThen, all of a sudden, I yawned. What a rude bastard, but I couldn\u2019t help it!\\nMr. Antolini just laughed, though. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, and got up. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix up the couch for you.\u201d\\nI followed him and he went over to this closet and tried to take down some sheets and blankets and stuff that was on the top shelf, but he couldn\u2019t do it with this highball glass in his hand. So he drank it and then put the glass down on the floor and then he took the stuff down. I helped him bring it over to the couch. We both made the bed together. He wasn\u2019t too hot at it. He didn\u2019t tuck anything in very tight. I didn\u2019t care, though. I could\u2019ve slept standing up I was so tired.\\n\u201cHow\u2019re all your women?\u201d\\n\u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d I was being a lousy conversationalist, but I didn\u2019t feel like it.\\n\u201cHow\u2019s Sally?\u201d He knew old Sally Hayes. I introduced him once.\\n\u201cShe\u2019s all right. I had a date with her this afternoon.\u201d Boy, it seemed like twenty years ago! \u201cWe don\u2019t have too much in common any more.\u201d\\n\u201cHelluva pretty girl. What about that other girl? The one you told me about, in Maine?\u201d\\n\u201cOh\\xa0\u2014 Jane Gallagher. She\u2019s all right. I\u2019m probably gonna give her a buzz tomorrow.\u201d\\nWe were all done making up the couch then. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours,\u201d Mr. Antolini said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re going to do with those legs of yours.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to short beds,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks a lot, sir. You and Mrs. Antolini really saved my life tonight.\u201d\\n\u201cYou know where the bathroom is. If there\u2019s anything you want, just holler. I\u2019ll be in the kitchen for a while\\xa0\u2014 will the light bother you?\u201d\\n\u201cNo\\xa0\u2014 heck, no. Thanks a lot.\u201d\\n\u201cAll right. Good night, handsome.\u201d\\n\u201cG\u2019night, sir. Thanks a lot.\u201d\\nHe went out in the kitchen and I went in the bathroom and got undressed and all. I couldn\u2019t brush my teeth because I didn\u2019t have any toothbrush with me. I didn\u2019t have any pajamas either and Mr. Antolini forgot to lend me some. So I just went back in the living room and turned off this little lamp next to the couch, and then I got in bed with just my shorts on. It was way too short for me, the couch, but I really could\u2019ve slept standing up without batting an eyelash. I laid awake for just a couple of seconds thinking about all that stuff Mr. Antolini\u2019d told me. About finding out the size of your mind and all. He was really a pretty smart guy. But I couldn\u2019t keep my goddam eyes open, and I fell asleep.\\nThen something happened. I don\u2019t even like to talk about it.\\nI woke up all of a sudden. I don\u2019t know what time it was or anything, but I woke up. I felt something on my head, some guy\u2019s hand. Boy, it really scared hell out of me. What it was, it was Mr. Antolini\u2019s hand. What he was doing was, he was sitting on the floor right next to the couch, in the dark and all, and he was sort of petting me or patting me on the goddam head. Boy, I\u2019ll bet I jumped about a thousand feet.\\n\u201cWhat the hellya doing?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cNothing! I\u2019m simply sitting here, admiring\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cWhat\u2019re ya doing, anyway?\u201d I said over again. I didn\u2019t know what the hell to say\\xa0\u2014 I mean I was embarrassed as hell.\\n\u201cHow \u2019bout keeping your voice down? I\u2019m simply sitting here\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI have to go, anyway,\u201d I said\\xa0\u2014 boy, was I nervous! I started putting on my damn pants in the dark. I could hardly get them on I was so damn nervous. I know more damn perverts, at schools and all, than anybody you ever met, and they\u2019re always being perverty when I\u2019m around.\\n\u201cYou have to go where?\u201d Mr. Antolini said. He was trying to act very goddam casual and cool and all, but he wasn\u2019t any too goddam cool. Take my word.\\n\u201cI left my bags and all at the station. I think maybe I\u2019d better go down and get them. I have all my stuff in them.\u201d\\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be there in the morning. Now, go back to bed. I\u2019m going to bed myself. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d\\n\u201cNothing\u2019s the matter, it\u2019s just that all my money and stuff\u2019s in one of my bags. I\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019ll get a cab and be right back,\u201d I said. Boy, I was falling all over myself in the dark. \u201cThe thing is, it isn\u2019t mine, the money. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s, and I\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Holden. Get back in that bed. I\u2019m going to bed myself. The money will be there safe and sound in the morn\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cNo, no kidding. I gotta get going. I really do.\u201d I was damn near all dressed already, except that I couldn\u2019t find my tie. I couldn\u2019t remember where I\u2019d put my tie. I put on my jacket and all without it. Old Mr. Antolini was sitting now in the big chair a little ways away from me, watching me. It was dark and all and I couldn\u2019t see him so hot, but I knew he was watching me, all right. He was still boozing, too. I could see his trusty highball glass in his hand.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very, very strange boy.\u201d\\n\u201cI know it,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t even look around much for my tie. So I went without it. \u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d I said, \u201cThanks a lot. No kidding.\u201d\\nHe kept walking right behind me when I went to the front door, and when I rang the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway. All he said was that business about my being a \u201cvery, very strange boy\u201d again. Strange, my ass. Then he waited in the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came. I never waited so long for an elevator in my whole goddam life. I swear.\\nI didn\u2019t know what the hell to talk about while I was waiting for the elevator, and he kept standing there, so I said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna start reading some good books. I really am.\u201d I mean you had to say something. It was very embarrassing.\\n\u201cYou grab your bags and scoot right on back here again. I\u2019ll leave the door unlatched.\u201d\\n\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I said. \u201cG\u2019by!\u201d The elevator was finally there. I got in and went down. Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was sweating, too. When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuff\u2019s happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can\u2019t stand it.\\n25\\nWhen I got outside, it was just getting light out. It was pretty cold, too, but it felt good because I was sweating so much.\\nI didn\u2019t know where the hell to go. I didn\u2019t want to go to another hotel and spend all Phoebe\u2019s dough. So finally all I did was I walked over to Lexington and took the subway down to Grand Central. My bags were there and all, and I figured I\u2019d sleep in that crazy waiting room where all the benches are. So that\u2019s what I did. It wasn\u2019t too bad for a while because there weren\u2019t many people around and I could stick my feet up. But I don\u2019t feel much like discussing it. It wasn\u2019t too nice. Don\u2019t ever try it. I mean it. It\u2019ll depress you.\\nI only slept till around nine o\u2019clock because a million people started coming in the waiting room and I had to take my feet down. I can\u2019t sleep so hot if I have to keep my feet on the floor. So I sat up. I still had that headache. It was even worse. And I think I was more depressed than I ever was in my whole life.\\nI didn\u2019t want to, but I started thinking about old Mr. Antolini and I wondered what he\u2019d tell Mrs. Antolini when she saw I hadn\u2019t slept there or anything. That part didn\u2019t worry me too much, though, because I knew Mr. Antolini was very smart and that he could make up something to tell her. He could tell her I\u2019d gone home or something. That part didn\u2019t worry me much. But what did worry me was the part about how I\u2019d woke up and found him patting me on the head and all. I mean I wondered if just maybe I was wrong about thinking he was making a flitty pass at me. I wondered if maybe he just liked to pat guys on the head when they\u2019re asleep. I mean how can you tell about that stuff for sure? You can\u2019t. I even started wondering if maybe I should\u2019ve got my bags and gone back to his house, the way I\u2019d said I would. I mean I started thinking that even if he was a flit he certainly\u2019d been very nice to me. I thought how he hadn\u2019t minded it when I\u2019d called him up so late, and how he\u2019d told me to come right over if I felt like it. And how he went to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all, and how he was the only guy that\u2019d even gone near that boy James Castle I told you about when he was dead. I thought about all that stuff. And the more I thought about it, the more depressed I got. I mean I started thinking maybe I should\u2019ve gone back to his house. Maybe he was only patting my head just for the hell of it. The more I thought about it, though, the more depressed and screwed up about it I got. What made it even worse, my eyes were sore as hell. They felt sore and burny from not getting too much sleep. Besides that, I was getting sort of a cold, and I didn\u2019t even have a goddam handkerchief with me. I had some in my suitcase, but I didn\u2019t feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening it up right in public and all.\\nThere was this magazine that somebody\u2019d left on the bench next to me, so I started reading it, thinking it\u2019d make me stop thinking about Mr. Antolini and a million other things for at least a little while. But this damn article I started reading made me feel almost worse. It was all about hormones. It described how you should look, your face and eyes and all, if your hormones were in good shape, and I didn\u2019t look that way at all. I looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones. So I started getting worried about my hormones. Then I read this other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not. It said if you had any sores in your mouth that didn\u2019t heal pretty quickly, it was a sign that you probably had cancer. I\u2019d had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks. So figured I was getting cancer. That magazine was some little cheerer upper. I finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk. I figured I\u2019d be dead in a couple of months because I had cancer. I really did. I was even positive I would be. It certainly didn\u2019t make me feel too gorgeous. It\u2019sort of looked like it was going to rain, but I went for this walk anyway. For one thing, I figured I ought to get some breakfast. I wasn\u2019t at all hungry, but I figured I ought to at least eat something. I mean at least get something with some vitamins in it. So I started walking way over east, where the pretty cheap restaurants are, because I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of dough.\\nWhile I was walking, I passed these two guys that were unloading this big Christmas tree off a truck. One guy kept saying to the other guy, \u201cHold the sonuvabitch up! Hold it up, for Chrissake!\u201d It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a Christmas tree. It was sort of funny, though, in an awful way, and I started to sort of laugh. It was about the worst thing I could\u2019ve done, because the minute I started to laugh I thought I was going to vomit. I really did. I even started to, but it went away. I don\u2019t know why. I mean I hadn\u2019t eaten anything unsanitary or like that and usually I have quite a strong stomach. Anyway, I got over it, and I figured I\u2019d feel better if I had something to eat. So I went in this very cheap-looking restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee. Only, I didn\u2019t eat the doughnuts. I couldn\u2019t swallow them too well. The thing is, if you get very depressed about something, it\u2019s hard as hell to swallow. The waiter was very nice, though. He took them back without charging me. I just drank the coffee. Then I left and started walking over toward Fifth Avenue.\\nIt was Monday and all, and pretty near Christmas, and all the stores were open. So it wasn\u2019t too bad walking on Fifth Avenue. It was fairly Christmasy. All those scraggy-looking Santa Clauses were standing on corners ringing those bells, and the Salvation Army girls, the ones that don\u2019t wear any lipstick or anything, were tinging bells too. I sort of kept looking around for those two nuns I\u2019d met at breakfast the day before, but I didn\u2019t see them. I knew I wouldn\u2019t, because they\u2019d told me they\u2019d come to New York to be schoolteachers, but I kept looking for them anyway. Anyway, it was pretty Christmasy all of a sudden. A million little kids were downtown with their mothers, getting on and off buses and coming in and out of stores. I wished old Phoebe was around. She\u2019s not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department, but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people. The Christmas before last I took her downtown shopping with me. We had a helluva time. I think it was in Bloomingdale\u2019s. We went in the shoe department and we pretended she\\xa0\u2014 old Phoebe\\xa0\u2014 wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes, the kind that have about a million holes to lace up. We had the poor salesman guy going crazy. Old Phoebe tried on about twenty pairs, and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up. It was a dirty trick, but it killed old Phoebe. We finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them. The salesman was very nice about it. I think he knew we were horsing around, because old Phoebe always starts giggling.\\nAnyway, I kept walking and walking up Fifth Avenue, without any tie on or anything. Then all of a sudden, something very spooky started happening. Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb, I had this feeling that I\u2019d never get to the other side of the street. I thought I\u2019d just go down, down, down, and nobody\u2019d ever see me again. Boy, did it scare me. You can\u2019t imagine. I started sweating like a bastard\\xa0\u2014 my whole shirt and underwear and everything. Then I started doing something else. Every time I\u2019d get to the end of a block I\u2019d make believe I was talking to my brother Allie. I\u2019d say to him, \u201cAllie, don\u2019t let me disappear. Allie, don\u2019t let me disappear. Allie, don\u2019t let me disappear. Please, Allie.\u201d And then when I\u2019d reach the other side of the street without disappearing, I\u2019d thank him. Then it would start all over again as soon as I got to the next corner. But I kept going and all. I was sort of afraid to stop, I think\\xa0\u2014 I don\u2019t remember, to tell you the truth. I know I didn\u2019t stop till I was way up in the Sixties, past the zoo and all. Then I sat down on this bench. I could hardly get my breath, and I was still sweating like a bastard. I sat there, I guess, for about an hour. Finally, what I decided I\u2019d do, I decided I\u2019d go away. I decided I\u2019d never go home again and I\u2019d never go away to another school again. I decided I\u2019d just see old Phoebe and sort of say good-by to her and all, and give her back her Christmas dough, and then I\u2019d start hitchhiking my way out West. What I\u2019d do, I figured, I\u2019d go down to the Holland Tunnel and bum a ride, and then I\u2019d bum another one, and another one, and another one, and in a few days I\u2019d be somewhere out West where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobody\u2019d know me and I\u2019d get a job. I figured I could get a job at a filling station somewhere, putting gas and oil in people\u2019s cars. I didn\u2019t care what kind of job it was, though. Just so people didn\u2019t know me and I didn\u2019t know anybody. I thought what I\u2019d do was, I\u2019d pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn\u2019t have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something, they\u2019d have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. They\u2019d get bored as hell doing that after a while, and then I\u2019d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life. Everybody\u2019d think I was just a poor deaf-mute bastard and they\u2019d leave me alone. They\u2019d let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars, and they\u2019d pay me a salary and all for it, and I\u2019d build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough I made and live there for the rest of my life. I\u2019d build it right near the woods, but not right in them, because I\u2019d want it to be sunny as hell all the time. I\u2019d cook all my own food, and later on, if I wanted to get married or something, I\u2019d meet this beautiful girl that was also a deaf-mute and we\u2019d get married. She\u2019d come and live in my cabin with me, and if she wanted to say anything to me, she\u2019d have to write it on a goddam piece of paper, like everybody else. If we had any children, we\u2019d hide them somewhere. We could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to read and write by ourselves.\\nI got excited as hell thinking about it. I really did. I knew the part about pretending I was a deaf-mute was crazy, but I liked thinking about it anyway. But I really decided to go out West and all. All I wanted to do first was say good-by to old Phoebe. So all of a sudden, I ran like a madman across the street\\xa0\u2014 I damn near got killed doing it, if you want to know the truth\\xa0\u2014 and went in this stationery store and bought a pad and pencil. I figured I\u2019d write her a note telling her where to meet me so I could say good-by to her and give her back her Christmas dough, and then I\u2019d take the note up to her school and get somebody in the principal\u2019s office to give it to her. But I just put the pad and pencil in my pocket and started walking fast as hell up to her school\\xa0\u2014 I was too excited to write the note right in the stationery store. I walked fast because I wanted her to get the note before she went home for lunch, and I didn\u2019t have any too much time.\\nI knew where her school was, naturally, because I went there myself when I was a kid. When I got there, it felt funny. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d remember what it was like inside, but I did. It was exactly the same as it was when I went there. They had that same big yard inside, that was always sort of dark, with those cages around the light bulbs so they wouldn\u2019t break if they got hit with a ball. They had those same white circles painted all over the floor, for games and stuff. And those same old basketball rings without any nets\\xa0\u2014 just the backboards and the rings.\\nNobody was around at all, probably because it wasn\u2019t recess period, and it wasn\u2019t lunchtime yet. All I saw was one little kid, a colored kid, on his way to the bathroom. He had one of those wooden passes sticking out of his hip pocket, the same way we used to have, to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom.\\nI was still sweating, but not so bad any more. I went over to the stairs and sat down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil I\u2019d bought. The stairs had the same smell they used to have when I went there. Like somebody\u2019d just taken a leak on them. School stairs always smell like that. Anyway, I sat there and wrote this note:\\nDEAR PHOEBE,\\nI can\u2019t wait around till Wednesday any more so I will probably hitch hike out west this afternoon. Meet me at the Museum of art near the door at quarter past 12 if you can and I will give you your Christmas dough back. I didn\u2019t spend much.\\nHer school was practically right near the museum, and she had to pass it on her way home for lunch anyway, so I knew she could meet me all right.\\nThen I started walking up the stairs to the principal\u2019s office so I could give the note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom. I folded it about ten times so nobody\u2019d open it. You can\u2019t trust anybody in a goddam school. But I knew they\u2019d give it to her if I was her brother and all.\\nWhile I was walking up the stairs, though, all of a sudden I thought I was going to puke again. Only, I didn\u2019t. I sat down for a second, and then I felt better. But while I was sitting down, I saw something that drove me crazy. Somebody\u2019d written \u201cFuck you\u201d on the wall. It drove me damn near crazy. I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kids would see it, and how they\u2019d wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them\\xa0\u2014 all cockeyed, naturally\\xa0\u2014 what it meant, and how they\u2019d all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days. I kept wanting to kill whoever\u2019d written it. I figured it was some perverty bum that\u2019d sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall. I kept picturing myself catching him at it, and how I\u2019d smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and goddam dead and bloody. But I knew, too, I wouldn\u2019t have the guts to do it. I knew that. That made me even more depressed. I hardly even had the guts to rub it off the wall with my hand, if you want to know the truth. I was afraid some teacher would catch me rubbing it off and would think I\u2019d written it. But I rubbed it out anyway, finally. Then I went on up to the principal\u2019s office.\\nThe principal didn\u2019t seem to be around, but some old lady around a hundred years old was sitting at a typewriter. I told her I was Phoebe Caulfield\u2019s brother, in 4B-1, and I asked her to please give Phoebe the note. I said it was very important because my mother was sick and wouldn\u2019t have lunch ready for Phoebe and that she\u2019d have to meet me and have lunch in a drugstore. She was very nice about it, the old lady. She took the note off me and called some other lady, from the next office, and the other lady went to give it to Phoebe. Then the old lady that was around a hundred years old and I shot the breeze for a while, She was pretty nice, and I told her how I\u2019d gone there to school, too, and my brothers. She asked me where I went to school now, and I told her Pencey, and she said Pencey was a very good school. Even if I\u2019d wanted to, I wouldn\u2019t have had the strength to straighten her out. Besides, if she thought Pencey was a very good school, let her think it. You hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred years old. They don\u2019t like to hear it. Then, after a while, I left. It was funny. She yelled \u201cGood luck!\u201d at me the same way old Spencer did when I left Pencey. God, how I hate it when somebody yells \u201cGood luck!\u201d at me when I\u2019m leaving somewhere. It\u2019s depressing.\\nI went down by a different staircase, and I saw another \u201cFuck you\u201d on the wall. I tried to rub it off with my hand again, but this one was scratched on, with a knife or something. It wouldn\u2019t come off. It\u2019s hopeless, anyway. If you had a million years to do it in, you couldn\u2019t rub out even half the \u201cFuck you\u201d signs in the world. It\u2019s impossible.\\nI looked at the clock in the recess yard, and it was only twenty to twelve, so I had quite a lot of time to kill before I met old Phoebe. But I just walked over to the museum anyway. There wasn\u2019t anyplace else to go. I thought maybe I might stop in a phone booth and give old Jane Gallagher a buzz before I started bumming my way west, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood. For one thing, I wasn\u2019t even sure she was home for vacation yet. So I just went over to the museum, and hung around.\\nWhile I was waiting around for Phoebe in the museum, right inside the doors and all, these two little kids came up to me and asked me if I knew where the mummies were. The one little kid, the one that asked me, had his pants open. I told him about it. So he buttoned them up right where he was standing talking to me\\xa0\u2014 he didn\u2019t even bother to go behind a post or anything. He killed me. I would\u2019ve laughed, but I was afraid I\u2019d feel like vomiting again, so I didn\u2019t. \u201cWhere\u2019re the mummies, fella?\u201d the kid said again. \u201cYa know?\u201d\\nI horsed around with the two of them a little bit. \u201cThe mummies? What\u2019re they?\u201d I asked the one kid.\\n\u201cYou know. The mummies\\xa0\u2014 them dead guys. That get buried in them toons and all.\u201d\\nToons. That killed me. He meant tombs.\\n\u201cHow come you two guys aren\u2019t in school?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cNo school t\u2019day,\u201d the kid that did all the talking said. He was lying, sure as I\u2019m alive, the little bastard. I didn\u2019t have anything to do, though, till old Phoebe showed up, so I helped them find the place where the mummies were. Boy, I used to know exactly where they were, but I hadn\u2019t been in that museum in years.\\n\u201cYou two guys so interested in mummies?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\\n\u201cCan\u2019t your friend talk?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t my friend. He\u2019s my brudda.\u201d\\n\u201cCan\u2019t he talk?\u201d I looked at the one that wasn\u2019t doing any talking. \u201cCan\u2019t you talk at all?\u201d I asked him.\\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\\nFinally we found the place where the mummies were, and we went in.\\n\u201cYou know how the Egyptians buried their dead?\u201d I asked the one kid.\\n\u201cNaa.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, you should. It\u2019s very interesting. They wrapped their faces up in these cloths that were treated with some secret chemical. That way they could be buried in their tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldn\u2019t rot or anything. Nobody knows how to do it except the Egyptians. Even modern science.\u201d\\nTo get to where the mummies were, you had to go down this very narrow sort of hall with stones on the side that they\u2019d taken right out of this Pharaoh\u2019s tomb and all. It was pretty spooky, and you could tell the two hot-shots I was with weren\u2019t enjoying it too much. They stuck close as hell to me, and the one that didn\u2019t talk at all practically was holding onto my sleeve. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said to his brother. \u201cI seen \u2019em awreddy. C\u2019mon, hey.\u201d He turned around and beat it.\\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a yella streak a mile wide,\u201d the other one said. \u201cSo long!\u201d He beat it too.\\nI was the only one left in the tomb then. I sort of liked it, in a way. It was so nice and peaceful. Then, all of a sudden, you\u2019d never guess what I saw on the wall. Another \u201cFuck you.\u201d It was written with a red crayon or something, right under the glass part of the wall, under the stones.\\nThat\u2019s the whole trouble. You can\u2019t ever find a place that\u2019s nice and peaceful, because there isn\u2019t any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you\u2019re not looking, somebody\u2019ll sneak up and write \u201cFuck you\u201d right under your nose. Try it sometime. I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I have a tombstone and all, it\u2019ll say \u201cHolden Caulfield\u201d on it, and then what year I was born and what year I died, and then right under that it\u2019ll say \u201cFuck you.\u201d I\u2019m positive, in fact.\\nAfter I came out of the place where the mummies were, I had to go to the bathroom. I sort of had diarrhea, if you want to know the truth. I didn\u2019t mind the diarrhea part too much, but something else happened. When I was coming out of the can, right before I got to the door, I sort of passed out. I was lucky, though. I mean I could\u2019ve killed myself when I hit the floor, but all I did was sort of land on my side. it was a funny thing, though. I felt better after I passed out. I really did. My arm sort of hurt, from where I fell, but I didn\u2019t feel so damn dizzy any more.\\nIt was about ten after twelve or so then, and so I went back and stood by the door and waited for old Phoebe. I thought how it might be the last time I\u2019d ever see her again. Any of my relatives, I mean. I figured I\u2019d probably see them again, but not for years. I might come home when I was about thirty-five. I figured, in case somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died, but that would be the only reason I\u2019d leave my cabin and come back. I even started picturing how it would be when I came back. I knew my mother\u2019d get nervous as hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin, but I\u2019d go anyway. I\u2019d be casual as hell. I\u2019d make her calm down, and then I\u2019d go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette, cool as all hell. I\u2019d ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to, but I wouldn\u2019t insist or anything. What I\u2019d do, I\u2019d let old Phoebe come out and visit me in the summertime and on Christmas vacation and Easter vacation. And I\u2019d let D.B. come out and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice, quiet place for his writing, but he couldn\u2019t write any movies in my cabin, only stories and books. I\u2019d have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me. If anybody tried to do anything phony, they couldn\u2019t stay.\\nAll of a sudden I looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was twenty-five of one. I began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady not to give old Phoebe my message. I began to get scared that maybe she\u2019d told her to burn it or something. It really scared hell out of me. I really wanted to see old Phoebe before I hit the road. I mean I had her Christmas dough and all.\\nFinally, I saw her. I saw her through the glass part of the door. The reason I saw her, she had my crazy hunting hat on\\xa0\u2014 you could see that hat about ten miles away.\\nI went out the doors and started down these stone stairs to meet her. The thing I couldn\u2019t understand, she had this big suitcase with her. She was just coming across Fifth Avenue, and she was dragging this goddam big suitcase with her. She could hardly drag it. When I got up closer, I saw it was my old suitcase, the one I used to use when I was at Whooton. I couldn\u2019t figure out what the hell she was doing with it. \u201cHi,\u201d she said when she got up close. She was all out of breath from that crazy suitcase.\\n\u201cI thought maybe you weren\u2019t coming,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s in that bag? I don\u2019t need anything. I\u2019m just going the way I am. I\u2019m not even taking the bags I got at the station. What the hellya got in there?\u201d\\nShe put the suitcase down. \u201cMy clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going with you. Can I? Okay?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. I almost fell over when she said that. I swear to God I did. I got sort of dizzy and I thought I was going to pass out or something again.\\n\u201cI took them down the back elevator so Charlene wouldn\u2019t see me. It isn\u2019t heavy. All I have in it is two dresses and my moccasins and my underwear and socks and some other things. Feel it. It isn\u2019t heavy. Feel it once\u2026 Can\u2019t I go with you? Holden? Can\u2019t I? Please.\u201d\\n\u201cNo. Shut up.\u201d\\nI thought I was going to pass out cold. I mean I didn\u2019t mean to tell her to shut up and all, but I thought I was going to pass out again.\\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I? Please, Holden! I won\u2019t do anything\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019ll just go with you, that\u2019s all! I won\u2019t even take my clothes with me if you don\u2019t want me to\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019ll just take my\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take anything. Because you\u2019re not going. I\u2019m going alone. So shut up.\u201d\\n\u201cPlease, Holden. Please let me go. I\u2019ll be very, very, very\\xa0\u2014 You won\u2019t even\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going. Now, shut up! Gimme that bag,\u201d I said. I took the bag off her. I was almost all set to hit her, I thought I was going to smack her for a second. I really did.\\nShe started to cry.\\n\u201cI thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all I thought you were supposed to be Benedict Arnold in that play and all,\u201d I said. I said it very nasty. \u201cWhuddaya want to do? Not be in the play, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d That made her cry even harder. I was glad. All of a sudden I wanted her to cry till her eyes practically dropped out. I almost hated her. I think I hated her most because she wouldn\u2019t be in that play any more if she went away with me.\\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. I started up the steps to the museum again. I figured what I\u2019d do was, I\u2019d check the crazy suitcase she\u2019d brought in the checkroom, and then she could get it again at three o\u2019clock, after school. I knew she couldn\u2019t take it back to school with her. \u201cCome on, now,\u201d I said.\\nShe didn\u2019t go up the steps with me, though. She wouldn\u2019t come with me. I went up anyway, though, and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it, and then I came down again. She was still standing there on the sidewalk, but she turned her back on me when I came up to her. She can do that. She can turn her back on you when she feels like it. \u201cI\u2019m not going away anywhere. I changed my mind. So stop crying, and shut up,\u201d I said. The funny part was, she wasn\u2019t even crying when I said that. I said it anyway, though, \u201cC\u2019mon, now. I\u2019ll walk you back to school. C\u2019mon, now. You\u2019ll be late.\u201d\\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer me or anything. I sort of tried to get hold of her old hand, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. She kept turning around on me.\\n\u201cDidja have your lunch? Ya had your lunch yet?\u201d I asked her.\\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer me. All she did was, she took off my red hunting hat\\xa0\u2014 the one I gave her\\xa0\u2014 and practically chucked it right in my face. Then she turned her back on me again. It nearly killed me, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I just picked it up and stuck it in my coat pocket.\\n\u201cCome on, hey. I\u2019ll walk you back to school,\u201d I said.\\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back to school.\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t know what to say when she said that. I just stood there for a couple of minutes.\\n\u201cYou have to go back to school. You want to be in that play, don\u2019t you? You want to be Benedict Arnold, don\u2019t you?\u201d\\n\u201cNo.\u201d\\n\u201cSure you do. Certainly you do. C\u2019mon, now, let\u2019s go,\u201d I said. \u201cIn the first place, I\u2019m not going away anywhere, I told you. I\u2019m going home. I\u2019m going home as soon as you go back to school. First I\u2019m gonna go down to the station and get my bags, and then I\u2019m gonna go straight\u2014\u201d\\n\u201cI said I\u2019m not going back to school. You can do what you want to do, but I\u2019m not going back to chool,\u201d she said. \u201cSo shut up.\u201d It was the first time she ever told me to shut up. It sounded terrible. God, it sounded terrible. It sounded worse than swearing. She still wouldn\u2019t look at me either, and every time I sort of put my hand on her shoulder or something, she wouldn\u2019t let me.\\n\u201cListen, do you want to go for a walk?\u201d I asked her. \u201cDo you want to take a walk down to the zoo? If I let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk, will you cut out this crazy stuff?\u201d\\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer me, so I said it over again. \u201cIf I let you skip school this afternoon and go for a little walk, will you cut out the crazy stuff? Will you go back to school tomorrow like a good girl?\u201d\\n\u201cI may and I may not,\u201d she said. Then she ran right the hell across the street, without even looking to see if any cars were coming. She\u2019s a madman sometimes.\\nI didn\u2019t follow her, though. I knew she\u2019d follow me, so I started walking downtown toward the zoo, on the park side of the street, and she started walking downtown on the other goddam side of the street, She wouldn\u2019t look over at me at all, but I could tell she was probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see where I was going and all. Anyway, we kept walking that way all the way to the zoo. The only thing that bothered me was when a double-decker bus came along because then I couldn\u2019t see across the street and I couldn\u2019t see where the hell she was. But when we got to the zoo, I yelled over to her, \u201cPhoebe! I\u2019m going in the zoo! C\u2019mon, now!\u201d She wouldn\u2019t look at me, but I could tell she heard me, and when I started down the steps to the zoo I turned around and saw she was crossing the street and following me and all.\\nThere weren\u2019t too many people in the zoo because it was sort of a lousy day, but there were a few around the sea lions\u2019 swimming pool and all. I started to go by but old Phoebe stopped and made out she was watching the sea lions getting fed\\xa0\u2014 a guy was throwing fish at them\\xa0\u2014 so I went back. I figured it was a good chance to catch up with her and all. I went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put my hands on her shoulders, but she bent her knees and slid out from me\\xa0\u2014 she can certainly be very snotty when she wants to. She kept standing there while the sea lions were getting fed and I stood right behind her. I didn\u2019t put my hands on her shoulders again or anything because if I had she really would\u2019ve beat it on me. Kids are funny. You have to watch what you\u2019re doing.\\nShe wouldn\u2019t walk right next to me when we left the sea lions, but she didn\u2019t walk too far away. She sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and I walked on the other side. It wasn\u2019t too gorgeous, but it was better than having her walk about a mile away from me, like before. We went up and watched the bears, on that little hill, for a while, but there wasn\u2019t much to watch. Only one of the bears was out, the polar bear. The other one, the brown one, was in his goddam cave and wouldn\u2019t come out. All you could see was his rear end. There was a little kid standing next to me, with a cowboy hat on practically over his ears, and he kept telling his father, \u201cMake him come out, Daddy. Make him come out.\u201d I looked at old Phoebe, but she wouldn\u2019t laugh. You know kids when they\u2019re sore at you. They won\u2019t laugh or anything.\\nAfter we left the bears, we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the park, and then we went through one of those little tunnels that always smell from somebody\u2019s taking a leak. It was on the way to the carrousel. Old Phoebe still wouldn\u2019t talk to me or anything, but she was sort of walking next to me now. I took a hold of the belt at the back of her coat, just for the hell of it, but she wouldn\u2019t let me. She said, \u201cKeep your hands to yourself, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d She was still sore at me. But not as sore as she was before. Anyway, we kept getting closer and closer to the carrousel and you could start to hear that nutty music it always plays. It was playing \u201cOh, Marie!\u201d It played that same song about fifty years ago when I was a little kid. That\u2019s one nice thing about carrousels, they always play the same songs.\\n\u201cI thought the carrousel was closed in the wintertime,\u201d old Phoebe said. It was the first time she practically said anything. She probably forgot she was supposed to be sore at me.\\n\u201cMaybe because it\u2019s around Christmas,\u201d I said.\\nShe didn\u2019t say anything when I said that. She probably remembered she was supposed to be sore at me.\\n\u201cDo you want to go for a ride on it?\u201d I said. I knew she probably did. When she was a tiny little kid, and Allie and D.B. and I used to go to the park with her, she was mad about the carrousel. You couldn\u2019t get her off the goddam thing.\\n\u201cI\u2019m too big,\u201d she said. I thought she wasn\u2019t going to answer me, but she did.\\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Go on. I\u2019ll wait for ya. Go on,\u201d I said. We were right there then. There were a few kids riding on it, mostly very little kids, and a few parents were waiting around outside, sitting on the benches and all. What I did was, I went up to the window where they sell the tickets and bought old Phoebe a ticket. Then I gave it to her. She was standing right next to me. \u201cHere,\u201d I said. \u201cWait a second\\xa0\u2014 take the rest of your dough, too.\u201d I started giving her the rest of the dough she\u2019d lent me.\\n\u201cYou keep it. Keep it for me,\u201d she said. Then she said right afterward\\xa0\u2014 \u201cPlease.\u201d\\nThat\u2019s depressing, when somebody says \u201cplease\u201d to you. I mean if it\u2019s Phoebe or somebody. That depressed the hell out of me. But I put the dough back in my pocket.\\n\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna ride, too?\u201d she asked me. She was looking at me sort of funny. You could tell she wasn\u2019t too sore at me any more.\\n\u201cMaybe I will the next time. I\u2019ll watch ya,\u201d I said. \u201cGot your ticket?\u201d\\n\u201cYes.\u201d\\n\u201cGo ahead, then\\xa0\u2014 I\u2019ll be on this bench right over here. I\u2019ll watch ya.\u201d I went over and sat down on this bench, and she went and got on the carrousel. She walked all around it. I mean she walked once all the way around it. Then she sat down on this big, brown, beat-up-looking old horse. Then the carrousel started, and I watched her go around and around. There were only about five or six other kids on the ride, and the song the carrousel was playing was \u201cSmoke Gets in Your Eyes.\u201d It was playing it very jazzy and funny. All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring, and so was old Phoebe, and I was sort of afraid she\u2019d fall off the goddam horse, but I didn\u2019t say anything or do anything. The thing with kids is, if they want to grab the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off they fall off, but it\u2019s bad if you say anything to them.\\nWhen the ride was over she got off her horse and came over to me. \u201cYou ride once, too, this time,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just watch ya. I think I\u2019ll just watch,\u201d I said. I gave her some more of her dough. \u201cHere. Get some more tickets.\u201d\\nShe took the dough off me. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you any more,\u201d she said.\\n\u201cI know. Hurry up\\xa0\u2014 the thing\u2019s gonna start again.\u201d\\nThen all of a sudden she gave me a kiss. Then she held her hand out, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s raining. It\u2019s starting to rain.\u201d\\n\u201cI know.\u201d\\nThen what she did\\xa0\u2014 it damn near killed me\\xa0\u2014 she reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head.\\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want it?\u201d I said.\\n\u201cYou can wear it a while.\u201d\\n\u201cOkay. Hurry up, though, now. You\u2019re gonna miss your ride. You won\u2019t get your own horse or anything.\u201d\\nShe kept hanging around, though.\\n\u201cDid you mean it what you said? You really aren\u2019t going away anywhere? Are you really going home afterwards?\u201d she asked me.\\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. I meant it, too. I wasn\u2019t lying to her. I really did go home afterwards. \u201cHurry up, now,\u201d I said. \u201cThe thing\u2019s starting.\u201d\\nShe ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time. Then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back. Then she got on it. She waved to me and I waved back.\\nBoy, it began to rain like a bastard. In buckets, I swear to God. All the parents and mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel, so they wouldn\u2019t get soaked to the skin or anything, but I stuck around on the bench for quite a while. I got pretty soaking wet, especially my neck and my pants. My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection, in a way; but I got soaked anyway. I didn\u2019t care, though. I felt so damn happy all of sudden, the way old Phoebe kept going around and around. I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth. I don\u2019t know why. It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could\u2019ve been there.\\n26\\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to tell about. I could probably tell you what I did after I went home, and how I got sick and all, and what school I\u2019m supposed to go to next fall, after I get out of here, but I don\u2019t feel like it. I really don\u2019t. That stuff doesn\u2019t interest me too much right now.\\nA lot of people, especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here, keeps asking me if I\u2019m going apply myself when I go back to school next September. It\u2019s such a stupid question, in my opinion. I mean how do you know what you\u2019re going to do till you do it? The answer is, you don\u2019t. I think I am, but how do I know? I swear it\u2019s a stupid question.\\nD.B. isn\u2019t as bad as the rest of them, but he keeps asking me a lot of questions, too. He drove over last Saturday with this English babe that\u2019s in this new picture he\u2019s writing. She was pretty affected, but very good-looking. Anyway, one time when she went to the ladies\u2019 room way the hell down in the other wing D.B. asked me what I thought about all this stuff I just finished telling you about. I didn\u2019t know what the hell to say. If you want to know the truth, I don\u2019t know what I think about it. I\u2019m sorry I told so many people about it. About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradlater and Ackley, for instance. I think I even miss that goddam Maurice. It\u2019s funny. Don\u2019t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.'", "label": "''", "lang": "None", "gen_para": "False", "gen_sent": "True", "gen_phrase": "False"}}
